Money has been at the epicentre of our society for thousands of years: it helps us trade, settle debt and purchase goods and services. Cryptocurrencies offer a fresh alternative to the conventional economy and monetary policy controlled by public institutions and central banks and therefore only a handful of government officials. 




## The Good: money facilitates trade

It all started with sea shell money to exchange goods in Asia, Africa and some parts of Europe. While this system was still up and running until the 18th century in some parts of Africa, large scale monetary systems quickly shifted to the precious metal standard. Rather than sea shells, money was based on commodities that were considered valuable.
Unlike barter-like methods of settlement, money helped communities fix the value of goods and services to a common unit of reference. The introduction of silver and gold standards help index the value of currencies to a fixed amount of precious metal.
 a  helped streamline business practices and ease the process of trading – since everyone was aware of and compliant with this common metric of value. 


## The Bad: governments control the total supply of currencies

After WWII, the Bretton Woods agreements of 1944 made the US dollar a global index to a fixed amount gold: it was therefore considered as the world reserve currency.
Non-reserve currency countries held a large portion of their reserve as US dollars for public intervention on exchange rates. Increasing pressure to devaluate the US Dollars led to the end of the Bretton Woods agreements in 1971. 
Today, currencies follow a floating monetary system: they are traded electronically, based on the rules of supply and demand. In this design, central banks or groups of central banks like the G7 may intervene by issuing or withdrawing currencies from the economy. 
The latest major intervention was during the last quarter of 2008 where major central banks purchased USD 2.5 trillion dollars of government securities and toxic assets. 

Today government backed currencies are not indexed to any tangible assets and are therefore floating against each other on the exchange. In other words, the market decides the price of each currency pairs through supply and demand dynamics. 
There is no value behind a unit of US dollar, other than the fact that it is considered as legal tender by the government.
Central banks control and monitor the price by either reducing or increasing the volume of currency supply in circulation.

### Reducing the volume of currencies

Also known as “Quantitative tightening”, it is the process of decreasing the total volume of money in order to control high inflation rates. 
Central banks can sell government bonds, increase interest rates or sell public undertakings to the private sector.
It makes borrowing less attractive and saving a better opportunity.
After a quantitative tightening intervention, the value of one unit of fiat currency increased

###    Increasing the volume of currencies

Also known as “Quantitative easing”, It is the process of injecting capital by printing fresh money and disbursing it back into the economy.
Central banks can buy back government bonds, decrease interest rates or purchase assets from private banks to increase the total supply.
It makes savings less attractive and loans less expensive.
After a quantitative easing intervention, the value of one unit of fiat currency decreases


The former monetary policy has not been implemented much in the past decade, while the latter, “quantitive easing” is constantly leveraged by government and central banks. 
It is one of the most popular forms of a monetary intervention post-2008.
Its aim is to control inflation (price stability) and ensure healthy employment rates by targeting the overall money supply. However, the performance of an economy is not just correlated with domestic activity but also subject to external factors, for instance, the growth of other economies, changes in consumption or major events. As such, Central banks and quantitative easing monetary policy can only impact the economy on a short term basis, since it does not have any influence on economic externalities. 
A simple analogy would be to compare Central banks and their policies with a doctor and his medication. If a patient comes in ill but with blurry and unknown symptoms, the doctor’s job is to cure his patient, or at least help him. He/She is going to prescribe medicines that might cure the illness in the short term but leave the patient with side effects.
While there is no secret recipe to keep prices stable and achieve full employment, central banks and public authorities attempt to cure the economy with quantitative easing - without hard proof of a long term positive impact.

Quantitative easing and tightening are considered as “direct” involvement of the public sector in the economy. An indirect monetary policy impact private banks activity and how they handle customers. Fractional reserve banking is an example of an indirect monetary policy where retail and investment banks are allowed to accept deposit and keep only a fraction of it as reserved, the remaining being lent to other clients or invested into ventures.  
A financial crisis occurs when this system fails and the total money supply does not expand. 
In other words, if every deposit holders decide to withdraw their savings at the same time, **there is not enough money for everyone**.



## The ugly: “Too big to fail” banks and their bailouts 


### Direct : quantitative easing

Quantitative easing has been leveraged rather aggressively after the 2007-2008 global financial crisis, starting with the 700 billion USD “Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008” aka the big banks' bailout. 
In fact, the total government bailout is gauged in trillions of dollars and not billions. As per the 2015 Special Inspector General for the Troubled Asset Relief Program (SIGTARP) - a US-based federal agency - the bailout that saved private financial institutions is estimated at 16.8 trillion dollars. There were no restrictions on the bailout capital – in other words, banks are free to spend it as they feel like.

This uncovered a series of bad practices within the financial sector as a whole:

*  Although banks created and sold toxic assets that ultimately caused a major crash and global economic depression, hundreds of bank got bailed out by governments as they were considered too big to fail. If public authorities rescue financial companies from going bankrupt - irrespective of their wrongdoings - isn’t it an incentivise to keep on taking huge risks? What stops them from replicating their actions, if worst case scenario, they get a government bailout?

*   At that time, banks had too much of an influence on the world economy to fail as per the regulator. The bailout money was used for mergers and acquisitions purposes: Bank of America with Merrill Lynch, Wells Fargo with Wachovia or Chase with Bear Stearns to state a few. This ultimately worsens the banks’ influence on the global economy: more than ever, banks are too big to fail.

* Rating agencies (Standard and Poors, Moody’s) score securities based on their performance and credit worthiness. Before the crash, toxic assets were rated AAA: the only issue here is that rating agencies are paid by banks to score their own products. Conflict of interest.

* Two of top financial institutions Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan Chase shorted on the price of toxic assets after the crash. This means they betted against the performance of securities that they created in the first place, and that caused the GFC. Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan were fined by the Justice department 550 and 300 million USD respectively for their illegal practice. The only issue is … both banks got a government bailout of 10 and 25 billion USD each.


Today, quantitative easing the go-to monetary policy implemented not only in the USA but in major economies worldwide – including Europe, UK, India and Japan to name a few. This raises a series issues :

* Unpredictable, the act is not transparent nor questionable by the public 
* Centralised, a small group of people decides whether or not to inject money into the economy. 
* Dilution, after an intervention, your money has less value since there is more money in the economy


### Indirect : Reserve fractional banking

After the global financial crisis, private banks were forced to increase their reserve requirements up to 10%. As such, increasing reserves takes money out of the economy while reducing it injects money into the economy.
The main issue here is that deposits can virtually be lent multiple times and therefore multiple interests are earned on the same deposit. 
Depositors are being assured that their money is in safe hands, which is not true: if every depositor claims back their assets, banks would not be able to disburse it back, as their reserves are too low to do. Fractional reserve banking is therefore by nature **unstable** and gives private financial institutions control over total fiat supply. If they keep on lending deposits over and over, this increased the money supply and dilutes the value of a single unit of fiat.

Most of the banks are insured and backed by central banks in case they are unable to disburse back deposits. This, in essence, creates a toxic incentivisation to banks: because they know their funds are backed by the regulator, they are free to take even more risks with their client's deposits.


## Cryptocurrencies: a hedging opportunity against the banking world.

Cryptocurrencies offer a tangible alternative to fiat and the banking system :

* Cryptocurrency are decentralised, there is no need for a centralised banking regulator per se.
* The concept of deposits and cross-border payment do not make sense as a cryptocurrency owner can control their wealth and send it across to another peer without the help of a third party.
* The total supply of money and its emission rate are transparent and known to all.
* There is currently no use-case of Reserve Fractional Banking - this does not mean it will not emerge in the upcoming years.


Now that you better understand how the banking world works, maybe it's time to invest in cryptocurrencies?
