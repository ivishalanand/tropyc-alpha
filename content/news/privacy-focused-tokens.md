Cryptocurrency’s first utility was to enable its holders to dissociate their financial behavior from their identity. While Bitcoin is not an anonymous coin, but rather pseudonymous, it still offers a privacy-focused form of money to the masses. 
As such, Bitcoin boomed when Silkroad started off: the delivery of illicit goods and services became available online to a wide audience. While Bitcoin’s intrinsic functions do not offer any anonymous feature, Silkroad customers and the likes use tumblers or mixers located on the deep web to partially anonymize their transactions. By doing so, users have to trust a third party to shuffle Bitcoin and re-issue them to a new public address. This has never been an optimal service as it is not considered “trustless” or decentralized. Furthermore, some blockchain analysis experts affirm that mixed Bitcoins can virtually be traced back to the original owner.

The rise of altcoins solved this issue or at least offered a more attractive solution to the problem. Today, there are dozens of privacy-focused cryptocurrencies, even some are integrated and widely utilized on dark web marketplaces.

Let’s have a look at the main cryptocurrencies in the privacy-focused token market and how they differentiate themselves.


## 1 Monero

Launched in April 2014 and forked from Bytecoin, Monero has established itself as the leading privacy focused cryptocurrency. It is based on the CryptoNote and Confidential address protocol and uses ring confidential transactions to improve security and privacy of its users. As such, public addresses are shuffled with older addresses on the network to avoid any privacy issues. In this system, it is virtually impossible for blockchain analysts to trace back a transaction and match an identity with a public address.

Monero developers intend to implement additional anonymity features onto the network such as Kovri, a router built on the Invisible Internet Project (I2P).

Consensus: Proof-of-Work (PoW)

Green flag
- Serious team of developer that values transparency, privacy, and excellence
- State of the art cryptocurrency fundamentals
- Integration with major Darkweb marketplace
- Strong community with helpful and accessible Core team members
Orange flag
- Developer's "banter" tweets have had influence on the price of the token in the past
Red flag
- None

## 2 Dash

Darkcoin rebranded itself to become DASH in 2014. It is a cryptocurrency that mixes coins from different senders into on single transaction with multiple recipients. In other words, several inputs are gathered into one emission to several outputs. This protocol, once named Darksend, is now called PrivateSend and can be defined by a decentralized mixing and tumbling service built in the cryptocurrency.

Consensus: Proof-of-Work & Proof-of-Service (PoW, PoSe)

Green flag
- Integrated with several merchants and with most of Darkweb marketplaces. 
Orange flag
- Aggressive promotion campaign that might create bias on so-called independent crypto media outlets
Red flag
- PrivateSend allows the identification of a transaction recipient, which leaves room for identity tracking through blockchain analysis

## 3 ZCash
Started in 2016 by a private company, Zcash enables the verification and privacy of transaction through zero-knowledge proofs in order to secure the network and allow anonymity for its users. Although owned by a private company ZCash's code is still open-source and available anyone can scrutinize it.
The implemented protocol, zk-SNARKS allows the verification of transactions sent to the network despite being encrypted. The ZCash blockchain only reveals the time-stamp of a transaction without the amount, the sender and receiver addresses.

Consensus: Proof-of-Work (PoW)

Green flag
- Third party code audit
- Integrated with several merchants and with most of Darkweb marketplaces. 
Orange flag
- Zcash does not ensure full anonymity intrinsically: transactions are public and users need to use a router to hide their identity.
- Zcash is owned by a private company called "ZEROCOIN ELECTRIC COIN COMPANY". Diversified crypto investment funds such as the Digital Currency Group and Pantera Capital have stakes in Zcash which may create bias in most of the cryptocurrency media outlets.
- First days of trading brought the price of Zcash up to a controversial 1,500 BTC per token.
Red flag
- Set-up and pre-mine of Zcash were done behind closed doors. A back door might exist on the blockchain making it possible to reveal every transaction or mine an infinite amount of coins: you'll have to trust ZCash's private company good will.
- 20% of mining rewards are distributed to the mother company.
- Since ZCash is a private company, they can be issued a subpoena by the regulator.


## 4 PIVX

The Private Instant Verifiable Transaction is a fork from DASH that occurred in 2016. Rather than implementing a duo consensus Proof-of-Work and Proof-of-Service, PIVX is secured through Proof-of-Stake. As such, users can lock 10,000 of their PIVX and run a master node that will "stake" their coins in order to reach consensus on the blockchain.
PIVX uses obfuscation, a mixing mechanism based on CoinJoin similar to DASH: inputs are gathered into one transaction and sent to multiple outputs. Theoretically, PIVX transactions can still be de-anonymised in the event of an attack or extensive blockchain analysis.

Consensus: Proof-of-Work (PoW)

Green flag
- Good marketing and communication
Orange flag
- Proof-of-Stake is at a nascent stage and could be broken theoretically.
- Not the best in class 
Red flag
- Not integrated into any Darkweb marketplaces.



## 5 Verge
Verge is an upcoming cryptocurrency that recently entered the market of privacy-focused tokens after a rebranding in 2016. Launched in 2014 as DogeCoinDark, Verge is a Bitcoin fork built on 5 different PoW algorithm to make sure miners with different hardware set-ups can access the network.  It has a Tor and I2P integration as its Unique Selling Point: a feature that other cryptocurrencies do not emphasize as any individual can run a wallet on Tor in no time.

Consensus: Proof-of-Work (PoW)

Green flag
- Multi-algorithm PoW consensus
- Strong community and support

Orange flag
- Marketed as an anonymous currency which is factually incorrect
- The community is relatively price-focused compared to other tokens. This may have a speculative impact on prices.

Red flag
- Poor Proof-of-concept academic paper
- Aggressive and suspicious promotion of Verge on social media (Facebook and Telegram especially) that leads to pump and dump price patterns.


## 6 Komodo

Komodo is a fork of Zcash without the 20% mining reward to developers: rather than owned by a private firm, Komodo relies on a community of developers and is part of SuperNET. As such, Komodo implemented a delayed-Proof-of-Work consensus mechanism on top of ZCash. The vision here is to enable assets to build their own blockchain and be secured by the Komodo blockchain - an extra layer of protection just like 2-FA. 

Consensus: delayed-Proof-of-Work (dPoW)

Green flag
- Fork of a cutting-edge technology without the controversial disbursement of mining rewards to developers
Orange flag
- SuperNET is competing with numerous other blockchains that are at a more advanced stage.
Red flag
- If ZCash has a set-up and collusion issue during the pre-mine, Komodo will be affected.


## 7 Particl 

Launched as ShadowCoin in 2014, the project's roadmap has always been to release a decentralized peer-to-peer marketplace: a blockchain based Silkroad.
While it is a not a privacy-focused cryptocurrency per se, Particl offers Darkweb marketplace users the perfect platform to purchase goods and services stealthily. And let's be honest, this is one the core utility of leveraging online anonymity.


Consensus: Proof-of-Stake (PoS)

Green flag
- Game-changing technology with high potential to disrupt the e-commerce industry at scale
- Passionate community
Orange flag
- Delay in milestone delivery
- Coinswapping from ShadowCash to PART came out of nowhere
Red flag
None
