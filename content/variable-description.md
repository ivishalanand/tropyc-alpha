  The cryptocurrency market is at a nascent stage making definition of some keywords somewhat confusing for beginners.  
We at tropyc attempt to make crypto users' life easier by delivering the fundamentals of crypto-economics.

For the past decade, tokens and coins are often seen as interchangeable although some researchers, businesses, institutions and enthusiasts differentiate coins from tokens based on their functionalities and the utility they provide to their holders. Often, a coin is reffered to as a token with solely payment attributes.

At this stage, there are no **official definitions of tokens, coins, initial coin offerings and tokensales.**

Because we are at the beginning of the crypto economy, Tropyc has decided not to differentiate a token and a coin and therefore considers tokensale, initial coin offering and crowdsale as interchangeable.  
Rather, our focus is to differentiate tokens on their function and the utility they provide to their holders.

Below are definitions of every variable we list on our tokensale description page - keep in mind that it is subject to change.

## Snapshot

* **Start / End**: Date for which the tokensale is open to investment.

* **Industry**: Classification that refers to the project's activity.

* **Founded**: Year and place where the company is registered and incorporated.

* **Platform**: Blockchain on top of which token is issued. A native platform means the token has its own blockchain.

* **Type**: Either it is a **cryptocurrency** meaning its value is derived from the blockchain on which it is built on, or a **crypto asset** meaning its value is not derived from its blockchain.

* **DEAL / TRUST**: Kindly refer to [rating framework](../rating-framework/).

* **Soft / Hard cap**: Minimum/maximum total token supply valuation in either a cryptocurrency or in dollars, depending on the investment sought during the tokensale.  
We are not evaluating the tokensale fundraising objective but rather the entire token supply.

## Concept

* **Description**: one liner of the project, what it is and what it is trying to achieve.

* **Features**: Value propositions of the project and unique selling points.

## Trust

* **Stage of the project**: The stage in the product life cycle: Ideation, MVP, Beta, Launch.

* **Team identity**: Whether founders have revealed their identity.

* **Partners**: Whether the project has relevant partnerships.

* **Advisors**: whether the project has relevant advisors.

* **3rd party audit**: Whether the project has hired a third-party auditor for code.

* **Multi-sig wallet**: Whether the project has put in place a multi-sig wallet in order to secure funds from the tokensale.

* **Disbursement date**: Date when the token will be released and issued to investors.

## Token

* **Functions**: Functionalities of the token that gives value to its holders, for now, we have identified the following: access, fuel, currency, incentive, ownership, governance, asset-backed.

* **Consensus**: How the blockchain is kept secured. It can be Proof-of-Work, Proof-of-Stake, Proof-of-Service, Proof-of-Activity, Proof-of-Burn, Delegated Proof of Stake, Byzantine Fault Tolerance.

* **Asset-backed**: Whether the token is considered as a tokenised asset.

* **Pre-mine**: Whether the token has been mined before the tokensale.

* **Similar**: Tokens that have similar features and from the same industry.

## Deal

Here we are splitting the total token supply distribution, in order to give a better understanding of how the deal is framed.
In our opinion, this is the most important variable to comprehend before investing in a tokensale.  
The DEAL tab will give you the valuation of the token supply, in cryptocurrencies and in fiat. You will understand how much is the cut of founders, early investors, advisors, pre-tokensale investors, future emissions and more.


## Roadmap

* **Website**: Whether the project has released a well-designed web application.

* **Whitepaper**: Whether the project has published a professional white paper.

* **Initial code**: Whether the project has proved that work has started.

* **MVP**: Whether the project has released a working Minimum Viable Product.

* **Beta**: Whether the project has launched its platform in testing mode.

* **Open dev**: Whether the project has made its code public and let third party developers contribute to the project.

* **Launch**: Whether the project has officially launched its product.

* **Community**: Whether the project has a community of users.
