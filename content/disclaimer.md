## Exchanges



The bitcoin and cryptocurrency exchanges listed on our platform were not all tested by our teams. 
Although we do believe bitcoin and cryptocurrency exchanges listed on tropyc are safe, we advise you never to store your coins for a long period of time. 
As such, you do not “own” bitcoins, cryptocurrencies and digital assets stored on an online wallet and exchanges: you hold an IOU (I Owe You), a promise that a third party will deliver you your coins when requested.

## Markets



Markets represent floating cryptocurrencies and tokenised assets that are available on crypto exchanges and considered as “established in the industry”.
The concept of establishment can be complicated to comprehend in such a nascent eco-system, that is why listing is not fixed and is subject to multiple modifications. 

Our beta listing framework for cryptocurrencies and tokenised assets is dependent on the following variables:



-	Market capitalisation


No low and middle market capitalisation coins are considered in the listing. 
As the aim is to gather the established coins in the crypto space, our database filters out nascent and upcoming tokens. 



-	Disruption


Tokens and their eco-syetem should be innovative in their fundamental functions and have a high disruption factor to global markets. Additionally, token should deliver a tangible utility to its holder.



-	Year


Only tokens older than 12 months are listed.



-	Volume and presence


Cryptocurrencies and tokenised assets should have a presence on major cryptocurrency exchanges with a high volume.



-	Fundamentals


The token distribution established during the initial coin offering of the token should be considered as fair and transparent between the founding team, token holders and other involved stakeholders (miners, early investors etc…)



-	Hype


The token’s community alongside with its communication channels (web application, social media, code repository, instant messaging) should be informative, transparent, and well maintained.





## Tokensale


We compile a list of Initial Coin Offerings also known as tokensale or crowdsale. As the industry took off late 2016 this investment vehicule is at a nascent stage, it is important to properly research opportunities before chipping in.
Tropyc’s tokensale and ICO listing *should not be considered as an endorsement to the project or as any sort of investment advice*. 
That being said, we still perform extensive due diligence and research on every tokensale we decide to add on our platform. 


By presenting key indicators and token fundamentals of initial coin offerings, our attempt is to make the screening process of such opportunities less confusing and more transparent for investors.

The TRUST mark assesses the project’s credibility to go through a fundraising round and evaluates the risk of fraud.

The DEAL mark assesses the project as a potential investment vehicle and how well it will perform in a non-speculative way.
