## Digital gold

Bitcoin is open-source money.

You can send money - digitally and securely 
without relying on a third party (bank, payment gateway, card issuers)

It is the first digital currency free that operates  securely, independently and free from government control

The first decentralised financial system that works.

There are now two distinct economies

      - issued and regulated by a government, a centralised financial authority. It has value because it is made legal tender by law.
      - transferred with personnal bank accounts, managed by third parties.
      Example  = USD, GBP EUR, INR, CHINA

      - independent from any central banks, and yet Bitcoin manages to offer a safe and decentralised electronic cash system. 
      The system is verified by digital signatures, secured by a trustless network consensus and runs on cryptography and algorithms.
      - users leverage encrypted signatures to transact without the need of a middle men

In 2008, Bitcoin was invented and mathematically proven by an anonymous author nicknamed “Satoshi Nakamoto”.


There are now over a thousand cryptocurrencies and cryptoassets.
Bitcoin represents 52% (API call coinmarkercap) of the total market capitalisation

      One bitcoin is divisible to the 8th divisible pace.
      This means you can split a Bitcoin into 100,000,000 units aka Satoshi
      100,000,000 Satoshis = 1 Bitcoin
