Bitcoin is open-source money.

You can send money - digitally and securely 
without relying on a third party (bank, payment gateway, card issuers)

It is the first digital currency free that operates independently and securely from government control

The first decentralised financial system that works.

There are now two distinct economies

- transferred with personnal bank accounts, managed by third parties
Example Â = USD, GBP EUR, INR, CHINA




### First steps
