## Store



Bitcoins are recorded electronically on wallets; it operates the same way than with cash wallets, but digitally.

The act of "sending a bitcoin" requires 3 things :


<div class="container my-3">
  <div class="row text-center mb-3">
    <div class="col">
     {{< img src="crypto-101/icons/public-address.svg" class="img-fluid" alt="mailbox" >}}
     <p class="font-weight-bold">Public address</p>
     <p class="small">A string of 26-35 characters, that holds bitcoin. Amount is publicly available on the blockchain</p>

    <div class="col">
     {{< img src="crypto-101/icons/key.svg" class="img-fluid" alt="key" >}}
     <p class="font-weight-bold">Private key</p>
     <p class="small">A file that proves to the network that you are the owner of a public address's balance</p>

### Public address



<div class="container my-4 align-items-center">
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col text-left">
      A public address serves as the recipient crypto bank account: a Bitcoin is held on a public address.
      All the transaction information between public address are available to everyone online on a decentralised ledger
      This means everyone knows how much Bitcoins a public address holds. 
      Therefore, make sure to generate a new public address when someone pays you in Bitcoin, otherwise … he’ll know how much you have!
    </div>
    <div class="col text-center">
      {{< img src="crypto-101/icons/public-address.svg" class="img-fluid" alt="mailbox" >}}
    </div>
  </div>
</div>




### Private key



<div class="container my-4 align-items-center">
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col text-center">
      {{< img src="crypto-101/icons/key.svg" class="img-fluid" alt="private-key" >}}
    </div>
    <div class="col text-left">
      Each public address is associated with one single private key that unlocks the funds held on it.  
      The network performs a mathematical algorythm to verify whether the pair is correct
      You can generate endless public address and private key pairs.
    </div>
  </div>
</div>




### Password



<div class="container my-4 align-items-center">
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col text-left">
      Write down your wallet's password and make sure you have a back-up in case you lose.

## Buy Bitcoin



Owning a Bitcoin has become easier by the day. 
Now that you want to get hold of some bitcoin, here are several ways to purchase some.




### Exchange


<div class="container my-3">
  <div class="row align-items-center">
    <div class="col text-left">
      Just like the stock and bond market exchange, you can buy cryptocurrencies on a specialised cryptocurrency exchange. An exchange acts a centralised marketplace and lets you swap fiat with cryptocurrencies at a given rate - decided by the market.
    </div>
    <div class="col text-center">
       {{< img src="crypto-101/icons/exchange.svg" class="img-fluid" alt="currency-swap" >}}
    </div>
  </div>
</div>



### ATM


<div class="container my-3">
  <div class="row align-items-center">
    <div class="col text-center">
       {{< img src="crypto-101/icons/atm.svg" class="img-fluid" alt="atm" >}}
    </div>
    <div class="col text-left">
      Exchange cash with bitcoin ATMs. These kioskes are located in major cities and connect you directly to the Bitcoin exchange.
    </div>
  </div>
</div>



### Over the counter 


<div class="container my-3">
  <div class="row align-items-center">
    <div class="col text-left">
      As opposed to centralised exchanges, you can join a dealers network and purchase some Bitcoin over-the-counter. This method is usually utilised for large bulk purchase
    </div>
    <div class="col text-center">
       {{< img src="crypto-101/icons/over-the-counter.svg" class="img-fluid" alt="merchant-selling-goods" >}}
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

    </div>
    <div class="col text-left">
     Bitcoin is digital cash at the end of the day. You can exchange some Bitcoin with fiat from friends and family, as long as you trust your transactor. There are risks of changing currencies with someone you do not know (physical attack ...), the same applies with bitcoin and cryptocurrencies.
    </div>
  </div>
</div>





## Spend

    <div class="col text-center">
       {{< img src="crypto-101/icons/brands1.svg" class="img-fluid" alt="amazon-microsoft-expedia-shopify" >}}
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

    <div class="col text-center">
     {{< img src="crypto-101/icons/card.svg" class="img-fluid" alt="card" >}}

    </div>
  </div>
</div>



### Marketplace


<div class="container">
  <div class="row align-items-center">
    <div class="col text-left">
    At first, bitcoin transactions thrived on gambling platforms and online marketplaces that enabled the distribution of illicit goods and services. These platforms still exist and you safely get delivered any type of product. Be sure to check your legislation before ordering anything.
    </div>
    <div class="col text-center">
     {{< img src="crypto-101/icons/third-party.svg" class="img-fluid" alt="merchant-selling-from-kiosk" >}}
    </div>
  </div>
</div>


Because Bitcoin has matured to a global market, more and more merchants are pushed to accept cryptocurrencies as a form of payment.
It has utility.
