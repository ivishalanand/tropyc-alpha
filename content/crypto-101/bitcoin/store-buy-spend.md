## Store



Bitcoins are recorded electronically on a wallet; 
it operates the same way than with cash wallets, but digitally.

The act of "sending a bitcoin" requires 3 things :

    <div class="col">
      Private key
    </div>
    <div class="col">

### Public address



<div class="container">
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col">
      A public address serves as the recipient crypto bank account : a bitcoin is held on a public address.
      All the transaction information between public address are available to everyone online on a decentalised ledger
      This means everyone know how much bitcoin a public address holds. 
      Therefore, make sure to generate a new public address when someone pays you in Bitcoin, otherwise … he’ll know how much you have!
    </div>
    <div class="col">
      {{< img src="crypto-101/icons/public-address.svg" class="img-fluid" alt="mailbox" >}}
    </div>
  </div>
</div>




### Private key



<div class="container">
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col">
      {{< img src="crypto-101/icons/key.svg" class="img-fluid" alt="private-key" >}}
    </div>
    <div class="col">
      Each public address is associated with one single private key that unlocks the funds held on it.  
      The network performs a mathematical algorythm to verify whether the pair is correct
      You can generate endless public address and private key pairs.
    </div>
  </div>
</div>




### Password



<div class="container">
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col">
      Write down your wallet's password and make sure you have a back-up in case you lose.
      Losing your wallet password means losing your cryptocurrencies
    </div>
    <div class="col">
      {{< img src="crypto-101/icons/password.svg" class="img-fluid" alt="password-lock" >}}
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

Let's compare fiat currencies and Bitcoin on this matter :

<div class="container">
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col">
      Fiat
    </div> 
    <div class="col">
      Bitcoin
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col">
      {{< img src="crypto-101/infographics/info-btc2-2.png" class="img-fluid" alt="fiat-crypto-bank-vs-wallet" >}}
    </div> 
  </div>
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col">
     Both the bank and the user have access to the account. Regulator can also step in and seize funds. 
    </div> 
    <div class="col">
      A single individual can store a private key and access funds digitally. No middle man and impossible to seize funds without a private key and password.
    </div>
  </div>

    <div class="col">
     Bitcoin is digital cash at the end of the day. You can exchange some Bitcoin with fiat from friends and family, as long as you trust your transactor. There are risks of changing currencies with someone you do not know (physical attack ...), the same applies with bitcoin and cryptocurrencies.

<div class="container">
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col">
    At first, bitcoin transactions thrived on gambling platforms and online marketplaces that enabled the distribution of illicit goods and services. These platforms still exist and you safely get delivered any type of product. Be sure to check your legislation before ordering anything.
    </div>
    <div class="col">
     {{< img src="crypto-101/icons/third-party.svg" class="img-fluid" alt="merchant-selling-from-kiosk" >}}

</div>


Because Bitcoin has matured to a global market, more and more merchants are pushed to accept cryptocurrencies as a form of payment.
It has utility.
