## Store



Bitcoins are stored electronically on digital wallets; it operates the same way than with cash purse, but digitally.

The act of "sending a bitcoin" requires 3 things :

      <h3>Public address</h3>
      A public address stores Bitcoin and is used to send and receive funds. In other words, a public address serves as a cryptocurrency bank account.
      All the transaction information between public addresses are available to everyone, and accessible online on a decentralised ledger called the blockchain.
      Therefore, everyone knows how much Bitcoins a public address holds. Make sure to generate a new public address when someone pays you in Bitcoin, otherwise … he/she’ll know how much you have!

    </div>
    <div class="col text-left">
      <h3>Private key</h3>
      Each public address is associated with a private key that unlocks the funds held on it.  In this sense, only the owner of funds stored in a public address has access to the associated private key. 
      When a transaction is issued, the network performs a mathematical algorithm to verify whether the pair is correct.  If a private key is made public, then the funds are compromised and unsafe - as anyone could issue a transaction.
      You can generate unlimited public address and private key pairs.

## Buy Bitcoin



Owning a Bitcoin has become easier by the day. 
Now that you want to get hold of some bitcoin, here are several ways to purchase some.





<div class="container my-3">
  <div class="row align-items-center">
    <div class="col text-left">
     <h3>Exchange</h3>
      Just like the stock and bond market exchange, you can buy cryptocurrencies on a specialised cryptocurrency exchange. An exchange acts a centralised marketplace and lets you swap fiat with cryptocurrencies at a given rate - decided by the market.
    </div>
    <div class="col text-center">
       {{< img src="crypto-101/icons/exchange.svg" class="img-fluid" alt="currency-swap" >}}
    </div>
  </div>
</div>




<div class="container my-3">
  <div class="row align-items-center">
    <div class="col text-center">
       {{< img src="crypto-101/icons/atm.svg" class="img-fluid" alt="atm" >}}
    </div>
    <div class="col text-left">
    <h3>ATM</h3>
      Exchange cash with bitcoin ATMs. These kioskes are located in major cities and connect you directly to the Bitcoin exchange.
    </div>
  </div>
</div>


 


<div class="container my-3">
  <div class="row align-items-center">
    <div class="col text-left">
    <h3>Over the counter</h3>
      As opposed to centralised exchanges, you can join a dealers network and purchase some Bitcoin over-the-counter. This method is useful for large bulk purchases.
    </div>
    <div class="col text-center">
       {{< img src="crypto-101/icons/over-the-counter.svg" class="img-fluid" alt="merchant-selling-goods" >}}
    </div>
  </div>
</div>






<div class="container my-3">
  <div class="row align-items-center">
    <div class="col text-center">
       {{< img src="crypto-101/icons/handshake.svg" class="img-fluid" alt="handshake" >}}
    </div>
    <div class="col text-left">
    <h3>Peer-to-peer</h3>
     Bitcoin is digital cash at the end of the day. You can exchange some Bitcoin with fiat from friends and family, as long as you trust your transactor. There are risks of changing currencies with someone you do not know (physical attack ...), the same applies with bitcoin and cryptocurrencies.
    </div>
  </div>
</div>





## Spend




Today, most of the services and goods are available for purchase through bitcoins





<div class="container">
  <div class="row align-items-center">
    <div class="col text-left">
    <h3>Merchants</h3>
     An increasing number of merchants accept bitcoins as a form of payment, including some billion dollar revenue powerhouses. Amazon, Microsoft, Expedia to name a few.
    </div>
    <div class="col text-center">
       {{< img src="crypto-101/icons/brands1.svg" class="img-fluid" alt="amazon-microsoft-expedia-shopify" >}}
    </div>
  </div>
</div>





<div class="container">
  <div class="row align-items-center">
    <div class="col text-center">
     {{< img src="crypto-101/icons/card.svg" class="img-fluid" alt="card" >}}
    </div>
    <div class="col text-left">
    <h3>Gift cards</h3>
     Gift cards that accepts Bitcoin such as eGifter or Gyft, cryptocurrency enthusiasts can now access an even larger pool of merchants (Starbucks, DunkinDonuts, Walmart, Gap). 
    </div>
  </div>
</div>





<div class="container">
  <div class="row align-items-center">
    <div class="col text-left">
    <h3>Marketplace</h3>
    At first, bitcoin transactions thrived on gambling platforms and online marketplaces that enabled the distribution of illicit goods and services. These platforms still exist and you safely get delivered any type of product. Be sure to check your legislation before ordering anything.
    </div>
    <div class="col text-center">
     {{< img src="crypto-101/icons/third-party.svg" class="img-fluid" alt="merchant-selling-from-kiosk" >}}
    </div>
  </div>
</div>


Because Bitcoin has matured to a global market, more and more merchants are pushed to accept cryptocurrencies as a form of payment.
It has utility.
