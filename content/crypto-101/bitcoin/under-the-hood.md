## Systems

- Consensus

### Mining

The main difference between fiat and bitcoin, is that the former can be printed without a limit while the latter is capped at 21 million.

### 2 icon top + text
- Printing fiat
In the current financial system, the amount of floating currencies is regulated by central banks – they can inject or remove money via a centralised system.
The amount of fiat money is uncapped as Central Banks have the power to print an unlimited supply.

- Mining bitcoins
The creation of Bitcoin is decentralised, transparent and follows an immutable mathematical formula
Bitcoin are not printed but "mined" by computers plugged on the network.
There will only be 21 million bitcoins mined.

Cryptocurrencies were once priced based on the prequeresites costs to run the blockchain or “mining costs.”

### 3 icon top + text
- Hardware
Miners allocate their computer horse power to the network : the more powerful the installation, the better the performance

- Energy
Computer equipment consumes power to function continuously. Energy is the main operational expense miners face

- Time
Resources could be allocated to another network. Miners invest not only their equipment but their time to the task


The network rewards miners in such a way, that they are incentivised to keep it secure

### 2 icon top + text
- Transaction fees
Issuing a transaction incurs a small fee, given to miners.
- Mining rewards
When a new block is generated, new bitcoins are mined and rewarded to the best miners


### Blockchain
A publicly available digital ledger that stores bitcoin, cryptocurrency or token information. 
The bitcoin blockchain is a series of blocks that holds transaction data of approximately 10 minutes of network activity.
Miners are the ones creating new blocks by solving a mathematical formula. By doing so, the network rewards them with freshly mined bitcoin 

### 7 icon side + text (add text)
Each blocks records the information of multiple transaction including
-the time,
-all transactions,
-the sender's public address,
-the recipient's public address,
-the amount
-the mining reward
-an unique idcode called hash.

- immutable
When a new block is generated, new bitcoins are mined and rewarded to the best miners

Every bitcoin transactions ever created and confirmed by the network are stored in a block. Every blocks are added on an immutable public distributed ledger, called the blockchain.

### Consensus

A transaction does not exist until it is generated in a new block. The network reaches a consensus to make the network safe and secure.

### 3 icon top + text
- Sign
A public address with sufficient funds signed with the correct private key 
- Generate
Miners gather transaction data and create their own block.
- Compete
All miners compete to get their block issued on the blockchain.

- Sign
Alice builds a transaction from her wallet.
She sets the recipient's public address and the amount
The public address requires the corresponding private key to be accepted
Alice signs the transaction with her private key that can be locked by a password.
The transaction is the sent online to the bitcoin network and blockchain (via wallets)

- Generate
Miners then create a new block from signed transaction and verify they are valid.

The block data is then converted into a hash by miners.

A hash is a fixed-length string that holds large amounts of data. Each blocks has a unique hash because it has a unique set of data. Changing one variable in the data will change the hash completely.

This way, the network knows if a fake transaction was inserted in a previous block, because each block's hash is part of the formula that generate a new block

- Compete
Once miners have a valid block and hash, they compete amongst each other to get their block added to the blockchain by solving a mathematical formula that involves hashing

The network sets a tougher hash solution as more miners compete, this way blocks are generated in a similar fashion, and not all bitcoins are mined simultanously.

Under hood, the network set every 2 weeks a hash target value : miners need to solve the problem by providing a valid hash inferior to the target.

Retargeting makes the difficulty evolve with the number miners connected to the network.

### Methodology

The method of incentivising resource-consuming activities in order to reach a network consensus is called Proof-Of-Work

This ensures

-generation of bitcoin is known to everyone
-creation of blocks occurs approximately every 10 minutes.
-miner incentivisation to secure the network
-safely prove ownership of a digital asset in a distributed and public network.

Miners are incentivised to secure the network
We are now able to safely prove ownership of a digital asset in a distributed and public network.
