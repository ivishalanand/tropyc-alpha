## The first cryptocurrency



Bitcoin is open-source money.

You can send money - digitally and securely - without relying on a third party (bank, payment gateway, card issuers). It is the first currency free that operates securely, independently and free from government control. 

Also known as "cryptocurrency", these new kinds of financial instruments offer an alternative to central bank backed currencies.

Bitcoin is simply put, the **first decentralised financial system that works.**

### Traditional or fiat economy



* Issued and regulated by a government, a centralised financial authority. It has value because it is made legal tender by law.

* Can printed endlessly by a central bank.

* Transferred from and to personnal bank accounts, but managed by third parties (your bank)

* No transparency and low privacy: government printed trillions of dollars since the 2008 financial crisis and yet there is low knowledge on how these funds are used. Credit cards companies, Tax authority and banks have access to all your financial life.

Example  = USD, GBP, EUR, INR, CHINA




### Decentralised or crypto economy



* Independent from any central banks, noone "owns" the Bitcoin network 
 
* Rate of emission (printing) is fixed, transparent and immutable. There will be only 21 million Bitcoin, not more than that.
 
* Users transact without the need of a middle men. It is secured by encrypted digital signature and runs on cryptography and algorithms.

* Perfect transparency and flexible privacy: everyone has access to every transaction that occurred on the network, and you can store your wealth anonymously at the same time.

Example  = Bitcoin, Litecoin, Ether, Monero ...




We can identify three main differences between them :


1 - You are obliged to trust a third party (a bank) to hold your wealth in fiat currencies, whereas with Bitcoin, you are the sole owner of your digital coins and do not have to trust anyone to store them.

2 - Central banks regulate their respective currencies and have the power to inflate or dilute the total supply. (FED in the USA, ECB in Europe, BOE in the UK, RBI in India etc...). On the other hand, Bitcoin future emission is planned, immutable and not controlled by a centralised authority.

3 - In fiat, we are not aware how freshly printed money is spent by governments and large financial institutions. Bitcoin addresses this issue by storing every single transaction on a distributed ledger, available to anyone called the blockchain. Additionally, Bitcoin holders have the choice to dissociate their wealth and their identity - something not possible with a traditional bank account as Know Your Customer (KYC) requirements are strict.

## Founder



In 2008, Bitcoin was invented and mathematically proven by an anonymous author nicknamed “Satoshi Nakamoto”. 
Supported by a team of developers and managed by Satoshi, the Bitcoin protocol came to notice in 2011 in mainstream media.
It is the most famous cryptocurrency and the largest one by market capitalisation. There are now over a thousand cryptocurrencies and crypto assets.

    <div class="col">
      One bitcoin is divisible to the 8th divisible pace.
      This means you can split a Bitcoin into 100,000,000 units aka Satoshi
      100,000,000 Satoshis = 1 Bitcoin

      There will be only 21 million bitcoin mined – and 99% of them will be available by 2031

Bitcoin offers an alternative to our financial system, it removes the concept of a middle man in a monetary transaction. 
The same way we were able to send messages via e-mail without the need of a  middle man.
You can now do the same ... but with money.




## Features


Let's review some of Bitcoin's core value propositions.


### Speed

<div class="container my-3">
  <div class="row align-items-center text-center">
    <div class="col">
      Sending bitcoin to anyone as quick as you can send an e-mail, without the help of a bank or transaction agent.
    </div>
    <div class="col">
      {{< img src="crypto-101/icons/speed.svg" class="img-fluid" alt="rocket" >}}
    </div>
  </div>
</div>



### Accessible 

<div class="container my-3">
  <div class="row align-items-center text-center">
    <div class="col">
      {{< img src="crypto-101/icons/accessible.svg" class="img-fluid" alt="door-open" >}}
    </div>
    <div class="col">
      Unlike bank accounts, there is no prerequisites, screening process, charging structures, consumer limits, nor account freezing.
      You have complete control over your capital.
    </div>
  </div>
</div>



### Safe

<div class="container my-3">
  <div class="row align-items-center text-center">
    <div class="col">
     Bitcoin are held digitally by its owner and no one else. Traditional bank accounts are vulnerable to currency inflation and a financial institution bankruptcy.
    </div>
    <div class="col">
      {{< img src="crypto-101/summary-icons/vault.svg" class="img-fluid" alt="vault" >}}
    </div>
  </div>
</div>



### Cheap 

<div class="container my-3">
  <div class="row align-items-center text-center">
    <div class="col">
      {{< img src="crypto-101/icons/cheap.svg" class="img-fluid" alt="price-is-low" >}}
    </div>
    <div class="col">
      There are no brokers or third party agents involved in the process, making the transactions fees considerably lower and more straightforward than in fiat
    </div>
  </div>
</div>



### Global 

<div class="container my-3">
  <div class="row align-items-center text-center">
    <div class="col">
     Just like the internet, bitcoin has no borders and belongs to no country. Geography is never taken into account in transaction fees..
    </div>
    <div class="col">
      {{< img src="crypto-101/icons/global.svg" class="img-fluid" alt="earth-spinning" >}}
    </div>
  </div>
</div>



### Private

<div class="container my-3">
  <div class="row align-items-center text-center">
    <div class="col">
      {{< img src="crypto-101/icons/lock.svg" class="img-fluid" alt="lock-chat-bubble" >}}
    </div>
    <div class="col">
      In Bitcoin, we have perfect knowledge of all the information regarding transactions (amount, sender, recipient) but with imperfect knowledge of identity.
In other words, a wallet may not be clearly associated with a person's name.
    </div>
  </div>
</div>



### Trustless

<div class="container my-3">
  <div class="row align-items-center text-center">
    <div class="col">
      Unlike fiat, no one can print additional Bitcoins. The total amount is capped to 21 million, its issuance is planned and transparent.
    </div>
    <div class="col">
      {{< img src="crypto-101/icons/trustless.svg" class="img-fluid" alt="ribbon-with-a-tick" >}}
    </div>
  </div>
</div>



### Transparent

<div class="container my-3">
  <div class="row align-items-center text-center">
    <div class="col">
      {{< img src="crypto-101/icons/transparent.svg" class="img-fluid" alt="magnifying-glass-with-gold" >}}
    </div>
    <div class="col">
      Sending bitcoin to anyone as quick as you can send an e-mail, without the help of a bank or transaction agent.
