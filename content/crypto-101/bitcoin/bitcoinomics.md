Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies'Because cryptocurrencies follow a more decentralised model, the process of creating new Bitcoin differs from the process of printing fiat money.

Bitcoin emission rate is known to everyone: the number of new Bitcoin generated per block decreases with time. Every ten minutes, the blockchain records this information : the amount of new bitcoins and whom it is rewarded to.

Miners earn return on investment by new Bitcoin created and transactions fees. As the mining incentivisation stays constant, transaction fees increases over time while block rewards reduce.  

The rate of mining Bitcoin is predictable and known to everyone on the network.

## Functions of Bitcoin



Everyone can use Bitcoin. Unlike conventional currencies, most of Bitcoin holders are individuals rather than institutions. Although Bitcoin is reaching new audiences by the day, would it be institutionalised investors or enthusiasts, it is difficult to estimate the proportion of household money in the cryptocurrency economy. That being said, anyone can look up the amount of every public address on the blockchain: the data is free and transparent.

### Store of wealth


An efficient store of wealth will not see its value decrease in the long term. In other words, selecting an asset as a store of value is the same as forecasting an increase the asset demand.

Precious metals, such as gold, have been historically efficient stores of wealth: they are durable, scarce, easy to identify and tough to forge.

Nicknamed the “digital gold” by Nathaniel Popper, Bitcoin holds similar characteristics, making it an eligible candidate for a new kind of store of value.

Unless a considerable share of the population perceives Bitcoin as an efficient store of wealth (just like gold), defining it as _efficient_ is debatable and controversial. 
Bitcoin has been a strong store of value since its existence: assessing its efficiency should always be relative to another class of assets.

Amid unstable economy, fast-paced globalisation and new technology breakthroughs, no one can point an item and declare with high certainty: “This is and always be a great store of wealth” - same applies to Bitcoin.



### Unit of account


The unit of account is the currency of measure that will be used to represent the real value of an economy. It translates the value of an item into a quantifiable unit that will be considered as the monetary convention.

For this matter, you can consider US Dollars as the world currency, or bitcoin, or gold, or even oil. Depending on your point of view we can analyse events differently:


{{< img src="crypto-101/charts/chart-eco-btcusd.png" class="img-fluid" alt="chart-world-gdp-btc-vs-usd" >}}
 
The above illustrates the state of the economy of World Bank Group participants (170+ countries) since 2013. In USD, the economy is somewhat stable, however, in Bitcoin, the economy is collapsing.

Cryptocurrencies are still infamous globally compared to established government-backed currencies: they do not represent a strong unit of account. However, it does not mean cryptocurrencies cannot fulfil this role in the future, it has all the required features to do so.

It is important to note that in the cryptocurrency world, Bitcoin IS the unit of account, as every alt coins are priced in BTC.



### Medium of exchange


The last and most important feature is already proven and established. 
Bitcoin's fast, safe and low-cost transaction triggered the exponential demand for cryptocurrencies and made Bitcoin what it is today. 
There is no doubt that today digital currencies are outperforming conventional banking services in cross-border and high amount transactions. 
As for domestic and low amount settlements, card issuers and banks are faster and cheaper for the consumer.

At first, Bitcoin as a medium of exchange started on the dark-web to settle payments on marketplaces because of its ability to dissociate someone's identity from money.

### Markets



##### Fiat 


Exchanges open 5 days per week and close on weekends and evening. It is possible to trade throughout the day but investors and speculators have to switch markets.

Bankers typically switch between America, Europe and Asia to operate continuously.



##### Crypto


Cryptocurrency markets are open 24/7 non-stop on independent exchanges and can be traded whenever you feel like it.

Bitcoin is the pioneer in digital money and is, therefore, witnessing aggressive growth thanks to its focus on privacy and peer-to-peer transactions. 

Prices are not stable and very volatile, compared to traditional currencies. It is not uncommon to witness a 50% price variation in a couple of weeks. A similar pattern in fiat currencies would shake up the global economy.

At first, the daily volume of transactions and exchange from fiat money to cryptocurrency were very low, making cryptocurrencies illiquid. But Bitcoin has established itself as the leading cryptocurrency, it is now very liquid - the same cannot be said for other cryptocurrencies.
