## Bitcoinomics

Because cryptocurrencies follow a more decentralised model, the process of creating new bitcoin differs from the process of printing fiat money

### chart supply + mining incentives

The rate of mining Bitcoin is predictable and known to everyone on the network.

Externalities cannot vary the issuance of bitcoin

Bitcoin are becoming more scare

More and merchants bitcoins are accepting Bitcoin as a form of payment

It's monetary system is not inflationist like in fiat, but desinflationist

This means blabla



Before considering bitcoin as a viable financial instrument, let's define its' possible use case.

### Who uses bitcoin ?

Everyone can use bitcoin. However, unlike conventional currencies, most of bitcoin holders are individuals rather than institutions. Although blabla this and that happened
 
It is difficult to estimate the proportion of household money in the cryptocurrency economy, but anyone can check the amount of all public addresses on the blockchain: this data is available to all.

### Store of wealth

An efficient store of wealth will not see its value decrease in the long term. In other words, selecting an asset as a store of value is the same as forecasting asset demand.

Precious metals, such as gold, have been historically efficient stores of wealth: they are durable, scarce, easy to identify and tough to forge.

Nicknamed the “digital gold” by Nathaniel Popper, Bitcoin follows similar characteristic making it an eligible candidate to being a new kind of store of value.

However, unless a considerable share of the population perceives bitcoin as an efficient store of value (just like gold), defining it as efficient is debatable and controversial. On the other hand, bitcoin has been a strong store of value since its existence and assessing its efficiency should always be relative to another class of assets.

Amid unstable economy, fast-paced globalisation and new technology breakthroughs, no one can point an item and declare with high certainty: “This is and always be a great store of wealth”


### Unit of account

The unit of account is the currency of measure that will be used to represent the real value of an economy. It translates the value of an item into a quantifiable unit that will be considered as the convention.

For this matter, you can consider US Dollars as the world currency, or bitcoin, or gold, or even oil. Depending on your point of view we can analyse events differently:

Cryptocurrencies are still infamous globally compared to established government backed currencies : they do not represent a strong unit of account. However, it does not mean cryptocurrencies cannot fulfil this role in the future, it has all the required features to do so.

That being said, in the cryptocurrency world, bitcoin IS the unit of account.


### Medium of exchange

The last and most important feature is already established. Fast, safe and low-cost transaction triggered the exponential demand for cryptocurrencies and made Bitcoin. 
There is no doubt that today digital currencies are outperforming conventional banking services in cross-border and high amount transactions. 
As for domestic and low amount settlements, card issuers and banks are faster cheapers for the consumer.

Bitcoin as a medium of exchange started on the dark-web to settle payments on marketplaces.

Bankers typically switch between America, Europe and Asia to operate continuously

- Crypto
Cypto markets are open 24/7 non stop on independent exchanges and can therefore be traded whenever you feel like it.

### Price

- Liquidity

Bitcoin is the pioneer in digital money and is therefore witnessing aggressive growth in adoption because of its security feature and peer-to-peer philosophy. It is important to mention that prices are not stable and very volatile (compared to traditional currencies).

At first, the daily volume of transactions and exchange from fiat money to cryptocurrency were very low, making cryptocurrencies illiquid

Because Bitcoin has established itself as the leading cryptocurrency, it can now be considered as liquid. However, most of the cryptocurrencies and cryptoasset are still illiquid
