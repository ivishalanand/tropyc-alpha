Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies follow a decentralised economic model: unlike the process of printing money, Bitcoins' issuance rate is transparent, immutable and fair.

Bitcoin emission rate is known to everyone: the number of freshly minted Bitcoins per block decreases with time.   
Every ten minutes, the blockchain records the number of new Bitcoins created and to whom it is rewarded.

Miners earn their return on investment both on transactions fees and new Bitcoins added to the total supply. As the mining incentivisation stays constant, transaction fees increase over time while block rewards are inversely correlated.  

The rate of mining Bitcoin is predictable and known to everyone on the network.  

* Externalities cannot vary the issuance of bitcoin.
* Bitcoins are becoming more and more scarce.
* Its monetary system is not inflationist like in fiat, but dis-inflationist.

## Functions of Bitcoin



Everyone can use Bitcoin.  
Unlike conventional currencies, most of Bitcoin holders are individuals rather than institutions. Although Bitcoin is appealing to new audiences by the day, would it be institutionalised investors or individuals, it's hard to estimate the proportion of household capital in the cryptocurrency economy.  
Still, anyone can look up the amount of every public address on the blockchain: the data is free, accessible and transparent.

### Store of wealth


An efficient store of wealth will not see its value decrease in the long term. In other words, selecting an asset as a store of value is the same as forecasting an increase in the asset demand.

Precious metals, such as gold, have been historically efficient stores of wealth: they are durable, scarce, easy to identify and tough to forge.

Nicknamed the “digital gold” by Nathaniel Popper, Bitcoin holds similar characteristics, making it an eligible candidate for a new kind of store of value.

Unless a considerable share of the population perceives Bitcoin as an efficient store of wealth (just like gold), defining it as _efficient_ is debatable and controversial.  
Bitcoin's prices have soared since its existence, therefore assessing its efficiency should always be relative to another class of assets.

Amid unstable economy, fast-paced globalisation and new technology breakthroughs, no one can point an item and declare with high certainty: “This is and always will be a great store of wealth” - the same applies to Bitcoin.



### Unit of account


The unit of account is the currency of measure that will be used to represent the real value of an economy. It translates the value of an item into a quantifiable unit: it becomes the monetary convention.

For this matter, you can regard US Dollars as the world currency, or bitcoin, or gold, or even oil. Depending on your point of view we can analyse events differently:


{{< img src="crypto-101/charts/chart-eco-btcusd.png" class="img-fluid" alt="chart-world-gdp-btc-vs-usd" >}}
 
 
The above illustrates the state of the economy of World Bank Group participants (170+ countries) since 2013. In USD, the economy is somewhat stable, however, in Bitcoin, the economy is collapsing.


Cryptocurrencies are still infamous globally compared to established government-backed currencies: they are not a good unit of account to value our economy because prices goods and services in Bitcoin are unstable.

However, it does not mean cryptocurrencies cannot fulfil this role in the future; it has all the required features to do so.

It is important to note that in the cryptocurrency world, Bitcoin IS the unit of account, as every alt coins are priced in BTC and not in USD.



### Medium of exchange


The last and most important feature of money is the ability to transfer value from one peer to another. Bitcoin is a perfect medium of exchange thank's to its core features we reviewed in Chapter I.
Bitcoin's fast, safe and low-cost transaction triggered the exponential demand for cryptocurrencies and made Bitcoin what it is today. 
There is no doubt that today, digital currencies are outperforming conventional banking services in cross-border and high amount settlements. 
As for domestic and low ticket transactions, debit and credit card as well as mobile money are all faster and cheaper for consumers.

At first, Bitcoin as a medium of exchange started on the dark web. Its primary use was for settling payments on illegal marketplaces to order illicit goods. Indeed, Bitcoin's ability to dissociate someone's identity with financial transactions made it the perfect "drug money". 
Today, many well-reputable merchants have integrated Bitcoin as a form of payment.

### Markets



#### Fiat 


Exchanges are opened five days per week but shut down on weekends and evenings. It is possible to trade throughout the day, but investors and speculators have to switch markets.

Bankers typically alternate between America, Europe and Asia to operate continuously.



#### Crypto


Cryptocurrency markets are open 24/7 non-stop on online exchanges: you can trade whenever you feel like it.

Bitcoin has pioneered digital money and is therefore witnessing tremendous growth. Thanks to its flexibility towards privacy, its peer-to-peer transactions, supply scarcity and hedging opportunity against the fiat economy, Bitcoin offers an attractive investment opportunity and fulfils to some extent the functions of money.

Prices are not stable and very volatile compared to traditional currencies: it is not uncommon to witness a 50% price variation in a couple of weeks. A similar pattern in fiat currencies would shake up the global economy.

At first, the daily volume of exchange trades from fiat to cryptocurrency were ridicule, making cryptocurrencies illiquid. But Bitcoin has established itself as the leading cryptocurrency: it is now very liquid, however, the same cannot be said for other cryptocurrencies.
