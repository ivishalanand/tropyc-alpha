# Ethereum : Decentralised Autonomous Organisation

Putting your money in a conventional investment management firm means trusting a third party with your wealth.
At the end of the day, how do you know if your money is in safe hands? 
It could potentially be a Ponzi scheme or worse the managers could flee with all the money and without notice.
What’s the solution? 

## DAO Concept

Imagine an investment management firm where shareholders do not have to trust any fund manager with their money: because shareholders would be the managers. 
Well, this is exactly what a Decentralised Autonomous Organisation (DAO) can achieve.
A Decentralised Autonomous Organisation is a leader-less entity that is run on a set of rules programmed by smart contracts. 
It automates interactions within an organisation company would it be governance, profit sharing or portfolio management. 
Through a voting system, DAO members can interact amongst each other and manage the organisation’s funds without trusting anyone but other investors alike.

#### Infographie


The same way bitcoin does not require a middle man in a transaction and offers an alternative to the current financial system, a DAO can make companies operate without a complex hierarchical system and manual processes. It digitalises and automates a pre-defined set of rules for organisations: it is not confined monetary interaction but should be considered for any sort of decision or governance problematic.
The goal here is make decision making more transparent, efficient and collaborative.

Since a DAO is built on programs, changing the purpose or some pre-defined operations can be deemed complex as the rules are hard-coded. In the event a smart contract has a glitch, developers may not be able to fix the issue. As such, depending on how they are built smart contracts can be immutable and therefore jeopardize the utility of a DAO.



## First implementation



The first attempt to set up such an organisation at scale was initiated on the Ethereum network and launched in 2016 as “The DAO”.
It started as an Initial Coin Offering, where tokens were disbursed to contributors against Ether. 
The organisation’s purpose was to become the first decentralised venture capital, where participants would vote for which projects the DAO would invest in. 
As such, the more stake (token) you hold, the more influential your vote is.

The Ethereum foundation developing team set up The DAO by programming all the smart contracts that made the organisation functional. This is how it went live:


1.	Developers built the DAO smart contracts on the Ethereum Blockchain.
2.	An Initial Coin Offerings sold DAO tokens against Ether during 28 days
3.	At the end of crowdsale, a smart contract disbursed automatically the tokens to investors: the DAO went live
4.	Anyone could seek funding on the DAO platform: token holders would either accept or reject proposals. 



The crowdsale launched on the 30th of April 2016 and closed on the 28th of May, when the tokens were disbursed to contributors. 
It was such a hit, that the DAO gathered more than 18,000 investors and approximately 14% of the total Ether supply issued to date: more than 11.5 million Ether. 
At this point of time, the DAO was worth about 150 million USD – something developers did not expect despite an aggressive marketing campaign.

Many independent developers warned the Ethereum community that the DAO was not secure enough to hold this amount of capital. 
The issue was not about the Ethereum network itself, but the smart contracts on which the DAO was built on. 
In fact, only one address held the entire DAO funds and were controlled by a smart contract, a red flag for most blockchain and cryptocurrency enthusiasts.


## DAO hack and fork

Unfortunately, the vulnerability got exploited only weeks after the DAO launch. 
An unknown attacker hacked the smart contract that held the funds and started draining Ether from the crowdsale.  
Nothing could be done as altering smart contracts code is not that easy once it’s deployed on a blockchain : token holders witnessed the attack live without being able to do much.  
Some attempted to separate the funds by pitching a project to the DAO, but this required token holders to vote and reach consensus: an action that was not feasible in such short notice.
Smart contracts are autonomous agents, independent from any third party or centralised influence: once deployed, code is the ultimate decision maker.

As such, the attacker was technically speaking _following the DAO rules_ (hardcoded in smart contracts) that were introduced by the Ethereum foundation developing team. 
For the Ethereum network this action was valid as it was deemed correct by the smart contracts, however, for the investors, it was clearly a programming mistake.

He or She moved the funds to a copycat DAO, nicknamed “The Child DAO” – where all stolen Ether were locked for a 28-day crowdsale period (as it was a replica of the original DAO). 
The address with the funds was ultimately visible on the blockchain: any attempts to cash out the Ether would potentially disclose the attacker’s identity. The hacker must have open a large shorting position on Ether to lock profits from the attacks. (bets that the price goes down)

The hack had a huge impact on the cryptocurrency world and eventually led to a price crash.
By the 18th of June, approximately 3.6 million Ether got stolen from the decentralised fund. 
In less than 48 hours, Ether price dropped from 20$ to 11$, and the DAO market capitalisation collapsed from 230 million USD to 85 million USD.
