# Ethereum economics

The Bitcoin network reaches consensus on its electronic payment system by leveraging miners’ computational power. Ethereum also gathers a similar network of computers to validate programs in a decentralised fashion – without the need of a middle man.


## Purpose

Just like with Bitcoin, the Ethereum blockchain relies on its own currency. Here, miners compete to earn Ether, Ethereum’s currency. While Bitcoin aspires to become world’s money, Ether has a different function: it should be considered as the “fuel” of the network. 
Developers and users pay transaction fees in Ether to run and operate applications on the Ethereum network. 

It incentivises deployment of efficient DApps (less code means less size means less fees) and creates an eco-system that rewards contributors. 

Bottom line is: Bitcoin has been nicknamed digital gold … 
Ether on the other hand is considered as “digital oil”.


## Consensus

Ethereum miners secure the network and get rewared with new Ether, a similar way that in Bitcoin mining.
Today, the consensus mechanism is also based on Proof-of-Work; however, the Ethereum developping team plans to transition from Proof-of-Work to Proof-of-Stake, by deploying an algorithm called Casper.

Rather than reaching consensus by mining or allocating computer horse power to the network, Proof-of-Stake cryptocurrencies select the next block creator in a deterministic way : based on their wealth (stake in the currency). 
There are no mining rewards in a Proof-of-Stake consensus : only transaction fees are here to incentivize miners.
Mind that Ethereum is yet to deploy this methodology.



## Supply

Ether holds different functions than Bitcoin: its token economics are built to handle the Ethereum network and its aspirations. Rather than being capped at 21 million coins, Ether has no fixed supply limit and was introduced by of the first Initial Coin Offerings in fall 2014. Here’s how it was distributed

*	60 million ether to the investors during ICO
*	12 million ether (20% of the above) for the developers, founders and early backers
*	5 ether mined on each new confirmed block: every 16 seconds approximately
*	2-3 ether are sometimes rewarded to miners who generated a correct block that was not added to the chain.


In this framework, 18 million Ether are added to the token supply per annum. 
If this rate of generation is kept indefinitely, the inflation would reduce every year and newly issued ether would replace any coins lost in the network (deleted wallets, incorrect address etc…). 
However, Ethereum plans to switch to Casper and a Proof-of-Stake consensus : token supply fundamentals are expected to change but should not be increased, rather decreased as per the founding team’s communication.

On a short term basis, Ether are "diluted" as the injection of 19 million units per annum has a significant impact on the total supply. Comprehend this token fundamental before investing into Ethereum.



## Transaction and wallets

Just like Bitcoin, Ethereum provides a safe, fast and reliable transaction management system with a few different features. 

Bitcoin blockchain holds a database of all transactions that occured on the network whereas the Ethereum blockchain tracks the state of every account in a single block

While Bitcoin has only one type of accounts (public addresses), Ethereum has two :

- Externally Owned Accounts (EOA) - unlocked by private keys, similar than with Bitcoin
- Contract Accounts - designed by a smart contract and unlocked by a pre-defined EOA’s private key.

The former is controlled by a human being - just like with Bitcoin - while the latter, also referred to as “smart contract”, is governed by code.

As such, contract accounts are very flexible : depending on how they are programmed, they can be controlled by a EOA (which is controlled by a human being) or disburse an amount to another contract account, all of which can be dependend on a fixed set of rules, terms and conditions hard coded in the program.
