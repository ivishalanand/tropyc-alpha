The Bitcoin network reaches network consensus on its electronic payment system by leveraging miners’ computing power. Ethereum works the same way, it also gathers a network of computers, but to validate _programs_ in a decentralised fashion.

## Purpose

Just like with Bitcoin, the Ethereum blockchain relies on its own currency. Here, miners compete to earn Ether, Ethereum’s currency. While Bitcoin aspires to become the world’s currency, Ether has a different function: it is the “fuel” required to run decentralised computer programs.  
Developers and users pay transaction fees in Ether to run and operate decentralised applications and smart contracts on the Ethereum network.  

It incentivises deployment of efficient DApps (less code, means less file size, means fewer fees) and creates an eco-system that rewards contributors.  

Bottom line is: Bitcoin is nicknamed **digital gold**,  
Ether, on the other hand, is considered as **digital oil**.

## Consensus

Similarly to Bitcoin miners, Ethereum miners secure the network and get rewarded with new Ether.  
The consensus mechanism has been following Proof-of-Work since inception, relying on both CPU and memory computing power; however, Ethereum has now shifted to a Proof-of-Stake based consensus, after the Metropolis hard fork.

Rather than reaching consensus by mining or allocating computing power to the network, Proof-of-Stake cryptocurrencies select the next block creator in a deterministic way: based on their wealth and how much they are willing to stake (locked on a node).  
Mind that Ethereum is yet to deploy this methodology: it is announced to start by November 2017.

## Supply

Ether has different monetary functions than Bitcoin: its token economics are built to handle the Ethereum network and its aspirations.  
Rather than being capped at 21 million units, Ether has no fixed supply limit and was introduced by one of the first Initial Coin Offerings during fall 2014. Here’s how the Ether distribution was designed:

* 60 million Ether to the ICO investors.
* 12 million Ether (20% of the above) for the developers, founders and early backers.
* 5 Ether mined on each new confirmed block: every 16 seconds approximately.
* 2-3 Ether are sometimes rewarded to miners who generate a correct block which was not added to the chain.

In this framework, 18 million Ether are added to the token supply per annum.  
If this rate of generation stays permanent, the inflation will reduce every year and newly issued Ether would replace any tokens lost on the network (deleted wallets, incorrect address etc…).  
However, Ethereum has switched to a Proof-of-Stake consensus: token supply fundamentals are expected to change but the overall Ether supply should not be _increased_, rather _decreased_ as per the founding team’s communication.

On a short-term basis, Ether are "diluted" as the injection of 19 million units per annum has a significant impact on the total supply.  
Take into account these token economic fundamentals before investing into Ethereum.

## Transaction and wallets

Just like Bitcoin, Ethereum provides a safe, fast and reliable transaction management system with a few different features.  
Similarly to Bitcoin, Ethereum blocks hold a database of all transactions that occurred after the previous block.  
Furthermore, the Ethereum blockchain issues a new block every 20-30 seconds, while Bitcoin and Litecoin blocks are generated every 10 and 2.5 minutes respectively.

While Bitcoin has only one type of accounts (public addresses), Ethereum has two :

- Externally Owned Accounts (EOA) - unlocked by private keys, similar than with Bitcoin.
- Contract Accounts - designed by a smart contract and unlocked by a pre-defined EOA’s private key.

The former is controlled by a human being - just like with Bitcoin - while the latter, also referred to as “smart contract”, is governed by code.

As such, smart contract accounts are very flexible depending on how they are programmed.  
They can be controlled by an EOA (human being), or hold funds and disburse to another account. They are crypto bank account programs, built with code.
