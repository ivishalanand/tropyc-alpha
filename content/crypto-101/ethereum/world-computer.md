## Centralisation of internet

Ethereum addresses one of the core issues of the internet today: centralisation of authority and trusting a third party. The same way Bitcoin is disrupting financial services, Ethereum addresses one of internet’s core issue: internet centralisation.
Let’s first have a look at how the world wide web operates compared to the decentralised model:

The current world wide web framework stores most of the data locally. In other words, when you visit a website you trust a third party to 

*	securely store your information (payment details, browsing history, passwords, identity…)
*	keep it safe from attacks (hacks, leaks)
*	avoid using it for illegitimate commercial purposes. (sell to third parties etc…) 


The problem here, is that there are no ways of monitoring how your information is handled, if it is safe or not, and whether a third party tries to deceive you. 
The NSA Snowden case and Wikileaks hack are just sample of what can happen to your personnal information.


A decentralised system utilizes nodes (computers connected to the network) to validate transactions, instead of a centralised “cloud” servers owned by a third party. 
This creates a trust less eco-system where the end-user does not have to trust one single entity. Rather, the information is cryptographically secured and distributed amongst all the participants of the network that verify its authenticity and record it on the blockchain.

Today we store our data on the cloud of internet companies such as Google Drive, Dropbox, Amazon or Box. We can compare both models of online storage:

Decentralisation offers _in theory_ a better file storage opportunity to the end-user: no third party has the control to view, edit, duplicate, delete or lock any files in the cloud

This methodology can be applied to every product and services. Ethereum aspires to become the “World Computer”: the platform that will enable the transition from a centralised internet to a decentralised one.




## World computer



Bitcoin is the first use case of blockchain technology and has without any doubt disrupted the banking and financial services sector. However, Bitcoin is just one of the possible application of a blockchain: the first cryptocurrencies acted as peer-to-peer digital currencies and were therefore limited to financial operations.
At this time, building decentralised blockchain applications required strong skillsets in cryptography, computer science, economics and whatnot.


Ethereum changed that.


Ethereum is an open-source and decentralised software platform, built on a blockchain, that enables development of decentralised applications onto its infrastructure (DApps). 


Thanks to Ethereum, developing DApps and issuing tokenised assets has become more accessible and less troublesome than building your own a native blockchain.
The vision is to replace conventional applications - like the ones you can find on the AppStore or Google Play – with decentralised ones, that won’t be governed and controlled by any corporations or centralised entities. 


In theory, no one will be able to control your information and behaviour as the system is considered “trustless” or "permissionless".




How? 


Ethereum is famous for introducing programming tools on top of its blockchain to make developer’s life easier.


*	**Smart contracts**: programs that can run transparently, in a trust less environment without any middle man. In other words, with smart contracts, you can program stakeholder relationships and automate interactions between themselves


*	**Tokensale and Initial Coin Offering infrastructure**: simplified framework to issue tokens, design the economics (supply, mining …) and plan the crowdfunding exercise (timeline, amount sought …) 

*	**Decentralised Autonomous Organisation (DAO)** : automation of stakeholder relationships within an organisation such as voting for governance, profit distribution or asset management.

*	**Decentralised browsers**: the new internet will be decentralised … in order to surf on the web 3.0 a decentralised browser is necessary.

* **Programming language**: Solidity is the ethereum language that can deploy DApps and smart contracts on the network. Ethereum gathers an active community that shares libraries, coding frameworks and contract development examples




## Team



How did a decentralised world computer developed on a blockchain managed to go so big? Well, because it is centralised.

The Ethereum Network is being developed and maintened by the Ethereum Foundation a non for profit based (legally) out of Switzerland.

In 2013, Vitalik Buterin, 19, first proposed Ethereum as a decentralised mining cum software development platform. Although he is not the Executive Director of the foundation, he quickly became the young face of the Ethereum revolution.
