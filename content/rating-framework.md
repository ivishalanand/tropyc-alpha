## Definition

Tropyc rates tokensales based on two marks : TRUST and DEAL.


The TRUST mark evaluates the risk of fraud and assesses the project’s credibility to go through a fundraising round. It is divided into 5 sub-marks :

* Token : Fair transaction of a utile token between investors and founders
* Roadmap : Communicate well the present and future project affairs
* Use-case : Eco-system that aspires to become sustainable and decentralised
* Safety : Ability to create a responsible environment for investment
* Team : Founding team is professional and fit to raise funds


The DEAL mark evaluates the project as a potential investment vehicle and how well it will perform in a non-speculative way. It is divided into 4 sub-marks :
 
* Distribution : Fair round of fundraising between investors and founders
* Economics : Concept is economically viable and has growth potential
* Awareness : Quality of brand image and how well it is perceived
* Longevity : Project has the resources to deliver and meet targets


The DEAL mark is a function of the TRUST mark:

* low TRUST mark means low DEAL mark
* high TRUST mark does not necessary mean high DEAL mark

Tropyc’s ICO analysis and rating is not an endorsement to the project and should not be considered as investment advice. Our intend is to make the ICO screening process less confusing and more transparent for investors.
