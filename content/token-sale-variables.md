The cryptocurrency market is at a nascent stage, tropyc attempts to better structure the screening process of crypto investment by providing fundamentals to end users.

Tokens and coins are often seen as interchangeable although some researchers, businesses, institutions and enthusiasts differentiate coins from tokens based on their functionalities and the utility they provide to their holders. 
 
At this stage, there are no **official definitions of tokensale, initial coin offerings, tokens and coins.**

Because we are at the beginning of the crypto economy, Tropyc has decided not differentiate a token and a coin and therefore considers tokensale, initial coin offering and crowdsale as interchangeable. Rather, our focus is to differentiate tokens and how they are introduced based on their function and utility.


Below are definitions of every variable we list on our tokensale description page - mind that it is subject to change.

## Snapshot

* **Start / End**: date for which the tokensale is open to investment

* **Industry**: Classification that refers to the project's activity

* **Founded**: Year and place where the company is registered and incorporated.

* **Platform**: Blockchain on top of which the token is developed. A native platform means the token has its own blockchain

* **Type**: Either it is a **cryptocurrency** meaning its value is derived from the blockchain on which it is built on, or a **crypto asset** meaning its value is not derived from its blockchain.

* **DEAL / TRUST**: Kindly refer to a Rating framework

* **Soft / Hard cap**: Minimum/Maximum total token supply valuation in a cryptocurrency, depending on the investment sought during the tokensale. We are not evaluating the tokensale fundraising objective but rather the entire token eco-system.


## Concept

* **Description**: one liner of the project, what it is and what it is trying to achieve.

* **Features**: Value propositions of the project and unique selling points


## Trust

* **Stage of the project**: the stage in the product life cycle: Ideation, MVP, Beta, Launch.

* **Team identity**: whether founders have revealed their identity.

* **Partners**: whether the project has relevant partnerships.

* **Advisors**: whether the project has relevant advisors.

* **3rd party audit**: whether the project has hired a third-party auditor for code and wallet security.

* **Initial code**: Whether the project has proved that work has started.
