  The cryptocurrency market is at a nascent stage making definition of some keywords somewhat confusing for beginners.  

For the past decade, tokens and coins have often been considered as interchangeable although some researchers, businesses, institutions and enthusiasts differentiate coins from tokens based on their functionalities and the utility they provide to their holders.  
Often, the consensus differentiates coin and token as below:

* a **coin** can operate independently, and its value is derived from the blockchain.
* a **token** is built on top of an existing blockchain and is not involved in the process of securing transactions.

This can get problematic when defining Initial Coin Offerings, as many project are introducing _tokens_, yet name their fundraising event an **"ICO"**.

Because, there are no **official definitions** of initial coin offerings, token generating event and tokensales, tropyc has decided _not_ to differentiate them for now, and to consider them as **interchangeable**. 

Rather, our focus is to differentiate tokens on their functions and the utility they provide to their holders.

Below are definitions of every variable we list on our tokens sale description page - keep in mind that it is subject to change.
