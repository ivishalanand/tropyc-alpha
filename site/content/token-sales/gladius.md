**Gladius**

By leveraging the blockchain to allow communication between computers, and a pay as you go marketplace, Gladius can facilitate the creation of the extremely fault tolerant and inexpensive pools tailored to a client’s specific needs.  

Aside from just filtering traffic, these pools will be able to accelerate content as well.  
Those paying hundreds of thousands of dollars for a service they never fully utilize can start paying for only exactly what they use - and for much less.
