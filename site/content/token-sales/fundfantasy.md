**FundFantasy**

**Functionality**

FundFantasy is the first provably-fair fantasy gaming platform for finance enthusiasts, powered by blockchain technology. Our platform enables trustless and transparent gaming, and is therefore a natural solution to well-known problems in both the online trading and the online gaming/gambling markets. When the age-old sports betting industry was revolutionized by the rise of Daily Fantasy Sports, people were reminded of the fact that good ideas can change the world. This is precisely what FundFantasy intends to do to the online trading market.

**01 Choose a contest**
Choose from a variety of different contests: Head-to-head, Multipliers, Winner-takes-all and more. Top-heavy contests will make sure winners get hefty prizes. Contests vary in duration and can range from 1 hour to a full month. Free contests are also available.

**02 Create a portfolio**
Users can choose assets from various asset classes including stocks, commodities, cryptocurrencies, and fiat currencies. Choose how much to invest and simply select the direction of the price, up or down.

**03 Win Large Prizes**
The FundFantasy platform will run using FundTokens (FUNDZ) - the FundFantasy payment currency. FUNDZ can also be used to purchase entry tickets to contests that pay out in other currencies such as BTC, ETH and more.
