**Stampify**

Stampify uses the blockchain’s distributed ledgers as the vehicle of new-generation corporate governance.  
The ambition is to build a community of connected and trusted organizations working together to make it grow, to streamline relationships between members – and create a frictionless business world.  

Organizations using Stampify will enter a community of new-generation, blockchain-governed companies, using a dedicated cryptocurrency whose tokens will be available for purchase during our crowdsale in January 2018.  

STAMPs holders will be members of the global collective community of companies embracing the new-generation business governance, and later the global business exchange through a business-specific currency for community-based markets
