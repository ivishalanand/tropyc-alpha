**Caviar**

Caviar is a dual-purpose token and crowdfunding platform that seeks to reduce investment volatility (“beta”) while capturing higher than average rates of return (“alpha”).  

Caviar will achieve these goals by combining investments in fast-appreciating crypto-assets with income-generating short-term loans, backed by real estate in the United States.  
By re-allocating funds between crypto and real estate markets, Caviar aims to provide income and growth via dual market exposure in a single token.
