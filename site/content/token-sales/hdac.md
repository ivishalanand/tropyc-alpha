**HDAC**

Backed by Hyundai BS&C, our new technology allows fast, secure and effective communication between IoT devices


**IoT contract**

It’s arrived. The Internet of Things (IoT) has transformed the world in to a gigantic, ever-evolving information platform. Anything that can be connected, will be connected. Now it’s time to embrace that connection for everything the IoT is set to become.

Experts have predicted that by 2025 there will be up to 30 billion connected devices, a number of which you regularly use on a daily basis. From smart homes, smart cars and smart watches to fitness trackers, VR headsets and any other wearable device (or indeed any device at all, for that matter) you could possibly imagine, the opportunity for safe and efficient “hyper-connectivity” is endless.

Our goal is to harness that opportunity to help you go “Beyond the Human Pay”. Through secure Blockchain technology, Hdac can assign contracts to all your smart devices to fit your life pattern. In layman’s terms, we make your life easier.

So, why Hdac? We’re the next generation digital service platform based on trust. And we’re just getting started.

Join us today. Thrive in the future.
01Why Hdac?

**M2M transaction platform**

You are your own bank.

Sounds good, doesn’t it? Thanks to our DAC (HdacT), our Beyond the Human Pay philosophy allows you to provide the currency your devices can use. You are in control, safe in the knowledge your transactions are interactively secure. 

Privacy is one of the biggest challenges facing IoT, so Hdac configures unique Hybrid Blockchain Networks for general and special purpose users. Our platform acts to support micro-transactions with state-of-the-art hardware wallets immune to viruses.

We’ve got all the bases covered. Your devices can enjoy a carefree connection, just as you intended.

**Hybrid Blokchain**

By fusing Blockchain with the IoT, we maintain core principles while you remain satisfied your connectivity, from user to device, is nestled among the safest of environments.

From private to public and back again, our Hybrid Blockchain is configured as a hidden network with safe tunnelling between a user and device to combat hacks, privacy invasions and external attacks. Remember, mutual authentication between device and user is crucial for a reliable Private Blockchain, which fundamentally will only be practical if it interacts with the Public Blockchain.

Choose Hdac. We’re not just jumping aboard a technological innovation – we’re turning it into a technological revolution.
