**Functionality**

Lendoit🏅 is decentralized P2P lending marketplace platform based on Ethereum, which connects borrowers and lenders from around the world using the advantages of Smart Contracts and the Blockchain technology.  

Loans can be given in any of the ERC20 currencies. The platform provides all the elements a lending market needs to function, namely: professional scoring and verification APIs for each country, a loan marketplace, where lenders bid interest rates on loan applications and a default market where failed loans can be traded.  

The Lendoit Smart Loan Contract also offers important functions like syndicated loans and the ability to sell a loan to another lender if needed.

How we differ from competing projects? > Many projects try to create P2P lending platforms on the Blockchain, and this is a sign of where the market is going, but most of the projects apply faulty implementing approaches.  

Our approach is unique and different and unlike others, Lendoit is the only platform which does NOT take collaterals.  
In the world of micro-loans, managing collaterals is not sensible - it’s like lending $USD by using €EUR as collateral.  

Lendoit platform combines 4 different efficient methods to mitigate the chances of our lenders to lose their money:

* 3rd party professional scoring/verification local companies
* Smart Compensation Fund
* Collectors Market where default debts can be sold
* Syndicated Loans.
