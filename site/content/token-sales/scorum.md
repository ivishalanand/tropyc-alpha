**Scorum**

Scorum is the first sports social media powered by blockchain. It’s specialized for creating sports content and provides fans with the freedom to shape their own information space and get rewarded for expressing themselves and sharing their passion for sports.

**Functionality**

Functionality-wise, Scorum is a new-generation sports media source that
features a blogging platform, integrated sports analytics services and a
commission-free sports betting exchange.  

We’ve already developed the beta version of Scorum’s statistics center; upon
which we will base the functionality of other services within the platform,
including the betting exchange and data visualization tools for bloggers.


At the moment, we are also developing special analytics tools for authors using
the BI-based services already integrated into the statistics center.  
Thanks to our decision to start product development with Scorum’s statistics
center, we have already received positive feedback about our platform from both
sports enthusiasts and professionals.


In other words, our team at Scorum is well on its way to transforming these beta
features into a fully functional platform. As we develop Scorum, we will continue
focusing on the needs of the sports community as a whole as well as its specific
segments.

**Reward System**

By using Blockchain technology as the platform’s foundation, we were able to
create a transparent and reliable reward system for Scorum authors and active
platform members.  
To implement this functionality, we issue Scorum Coins (SCR) cryptocurrency
and Scorum Power (SP) tokens.

**Built-in Instruments for Authors**

The Scorum blogging platform makes it easy for content creators to design
engaging and visually appealing content, which in turn allows authors to focus
their effort on writing quality publications about sports.

Aside from the simple yet feature-rich editing tools, we have developed custom
solutions for sports writers:

1. Widgets displaying statistics center data which can be incorporated into
publications with just a few clicks.  
2. Built-in photo database where authors can get quality images for their
publications.  
3. Sports analytics tools which allow content creators to quickly create
interactive data visuals.

We are developing Scorum’s features with the focus on sports media audience
interests which allows us to preserve the platform’s ease of use while
maintaining its high level of functionality.

*Statistics Center*

The statistics center provides users with information about various kinds of
sports as well as match results, statistical data, player and team profiles, and live
match broadcasts. Users will also be able to purchase sporting goods and
services like event tickets from our partners.  
For authors the statistics center offers a new generation of sports analytics
tools that enable content writers to create interactive visuals with the help of the
center’s built-in BI services. AI-based services such as forecasting system,
sports texts analysis, sports chat bots and more will also be available within the
statistics center.  
Within Scorum’s partner programs we have already integrated Microsoft’s Power
BI and are planning to add similar services from Google and IBM in the future.

*Commission-free Betting Exchange*

Scorum's commission-free sports betting exchange is fully capable of potentially
replacing traditional betting platforms. Within Scorum, users can quickly and
easily bet against each other without having to pay any commission or extra
fees.  
It’s worth noting that the betting exchange is not a source of income for the
Scorum platform and acts solely as a marketing tool that stimulates growth of
the Scorum Coins cryptocurrency. Furthermore, Scorum provides the betting
exchange for entertainment value only as a game of skill for it users. The betting
exchange shall not be accessible in jurisdictions where it may be prohibited or
require further licensing under such jurisdiction’s online gambling laws. Based on
data cited by the BBC, the potential market volume for the cryptocurrency sports
betting market exceeds 1 trillion USD.  

Due to the uncertain state of regulation on a global scale in the field of virtual
token betting, we cannot guarantee the legality of Scorum betting exchange
platform or ability to structure and license our future betting exchange platform
in any given jurisdiction. However, we strive to be a responsive and compliant
company should we face any regulatory inquiry.
