**Functionalities**

Our mission is to make human personality analysis methods more accessible, better justified and qualitative, as well as applicable in various spheres​​ of​​ life.

HD ecosystem takes into account all of its participants' interests:

* Users get access to a set of high-quality methods and a reward for providing their information.  

* Authors of methods receive a convenient environment for implementation oftheir ideas without the need to dig into the programming and commercialization of products for end users.  

* Entrepreneurs receive a marketplace of various methods ready for commercial use and a potential consumer audience.

There are a lot of examples of times when analysis of large amounts of data has allowed users to make a qualitative leap in the development of a specific 3 company or entire industry, contributing to breakthroughs in social and scientific studies.  

As a result of the development of the HD Platform, for the first time in the history of mankind, we'll have a sufficient scope of data for application of such effective tools as machine learning, clusterization, collaborative filtering, and many other data related to psychological behavior and the inner world of people.  

Analysis of these data points will allow for new findings and help people to
develop more harmonious relationships with themselves, with people
around​​them,​​and​​with​​the​​entire​​world.
