**Globcoin**

GLOBCOIN Crypto Platform (GCP, or GC platform) provides the infrastructure to build baskets of currencies
corresponding to specific communities/users' needs.

In a globalised world, your own national currency does not really measure your wealth, except in the sense
that it is handy for accounting or payment purposes. Whereas, currency baskets can prove to be the
appropriate solution for a variety of needs, this is probably the reason for the growing trend from Central Banks
to build up currency baskets and/or to peg the national currency to a basket which is usually not disclosed to
the public (China, Singapore).

GCP founders have been at the forefront of innovation in currency management for decades, proposing to
their large clients (Institutional and family offices) dedicated currency baskets tailored to their own specific
needs.

The first basket that will be launched on GC platform will be our “flagship “ GLOBCOIN, a basket based on the
15 largest currencies of the world and 5 % weighted in Gold. This basket corresponds to the needs of many
users. This basket is already traded for our large clients on a traditional foreign exchange forward market.
By construction, it will be 100% asset-backed and very stable. It will be an ideal complement for a
cryptocurrencies holders wanting to stay in the crypto world but looking to secure part of their portfolio.
Other currency baskets have already been studied for specific clients in Asia, Africa and Western Europe and
GC platform will be able to launch and manage such dedicated baskets according to client needs provided
that the constituents of the basket are tradable.

We will also add a basket to our current GLOBCOIN multi-currency prepaid card so that people (in addition to
their needs in fiat currencies) can buy a basket in just one click.

As explained, the basket concept was previously reserved for large clients due to the structure of foreign
exchange markets. Thanks to Blockchain Technology, it is now possible to offer the basket concept
to the public. The decentralisation enables us to provide solutions that were formerly reserved to a few
privileged market participants.

Isn’t it a revolution that anyone, easily and at very reasonable costs, can behave like a central bank, managing
currency risk?

The purpose of the Token sale (GCP) is to:

* provide additional funding to enhance the current platform, taking advantage of the best of blockchain
technology.
* make the platform available to the largest community of users.
* disseminate the use of dedicated baskets in specific regions of the World, in accordance with the local
regulations that may apply in such places.

The GCP token is expected to directly benefit from the growth of the use of the platform through reward
programs.
