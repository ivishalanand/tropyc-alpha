**FluzFluz**

One of the first off-the-chain projects potentially introducing millions of people to the concept of a cash back consumer network. Already built relationships with global and local brands and are now acting as a market place between their business and the end consumer based on our digital gift mechanism.

**Functionality**

Fluz Fluz disrupts the traditional shopping experience through an alternate, more rewarding avenue.  
In the Fluz Fluz consumer network model, all participants make money, thereby creating high consumer stickiness and a sustainable business model.

Fluz Fluz’s stickiness is derived fromthe fact that network members (akaFluzzers) can generate significant cash back rewards through their everyday household purchases and the purchases of their extended social network.  

FluzFluz operates as an instantaneous digital retail code marketplace where consumption codes can be redeemed at retail POS, and generate Fluz points for the purchaser and their participating upstream network.  

In our binary network model each Fluzzer’s network can grow up to 65,535 members through 15 downline network levels.  

The total cash back is split 50/50 between the
purchasing Fluzzer and the participating
upstream network
