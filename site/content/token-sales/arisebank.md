**AriseBank**

We present the first decentralized banking platform. While the main purpose of AriseBank is to
operate in a truly decentralized format, users can also operate in a semi-decentralized format,
where fiat currencies, traditional banking services, debit cards and credit cards can be utilized
alongside AriseBank’s many cryptocurrency services. AriseBank isn’t just an idea, it is already
working and currently being tested in BETA by customers around the globe. Our platform is
already integrated with over 700 cryptocurrencies and has more platform features than any
other cryptocurrency software currently available on the market. 

First, we will outline the entire aBank banking platform and its features throughout multiple
chapters, how we utilize our large set of developer tools and our growing network of Sunrise
APIs and SDKs to help back the aBank platform’s decentralized network. We also introduce a
new way of adhering to KYC regulations, while also keeping customer data private and secure
with AriseID and how AriseBank is still able to offer AriseCard and other services, even in this
decentralized landscape. This whitepaper also offers details in relation to the ongoing
AriseCoin ICO and how AriseCoin works alongside the AriseBank platform to accomplish our
true mission of ending the reign of the Federal Reserve and killing poverty at its core.
