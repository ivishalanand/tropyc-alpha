The cryptocurrency market has surged at an impressive rate the last year, booming from $17bn to $220bn YTD.

The thing is, blockchain technology may get confusing for less tech-savvy individuals, as the barriers to understanding it are incredibly high.

This chart sums up well the situation:

As most of the societal decision-making is made by only a handful of leaders - whether they are elected officials, bureaucrats or industry captains - leaders also struggle to understand how cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology work.

Expecting them to forecast the impact of this disruptive technology is of no use.  
Instead, we should comprehend that blockchain, bitcoin and cryptocurrencies are not a technology, **they are a cultural paradigm shift**.

## Crypto does not need you

As long as one computer (running node) is plugged on the blockchain, cryptocurrencies will run effectively.

With the latest Bitcoin Cash hard fork and SegWit 2x controversy, now more than ever, one needs to understand that Bitcoin (and any other crypto) does not need anyone, does not need help to defend it as one can only defend its own perspective of a chain.

You're free to fork a cryptocurrency, implement your changes - no one will stop you.

Pricing cryptocurrencies and digital assets is a different story. It is only the process of determining the value of a unit by fixing a price tag. 
The value of cryptocurrencies shouldn't be price related, rather, it comes from utility - which introduces our second point.

## You are your own bank

Thanks to cryptography (private key and public addresses), access to financial services have become less cumbersome.

In theory, the only barrier to open a cryptocurrency "account" is access to an offline and secure private/public key generator.

Blockchain and distributed ledger technology have reduced costs of transaction considerably, making traditional payment protocols like SWIFT less attractive.

Finally, cryptocurrencies give the opportunity for anyone to take part in private transactions - something unimaginable a decade ago.

## The concept of Unbanked could be no more

As per the World Bank, more than 38% of the global population does not have access to any kind of financial services.
In developing countries, it goes up to 54% and 86% in the Middle East.

With the [failure of Microfinance](https://hbr.org/2007/09/beware-of-bad-microcredit) and the lack of evidence to stimulate any positive impact on poverty ([as shown by MIT](http://economics.mit.edu/files/5993)), institutions need to find an alternative to the current framework put in place.  

As such, cryptocurrencies appear as a promising opportunity for the most vulnerable to get access to financial services.

## IoT won't work without crypto

The Internet of Things has witnessed similar, if not superior, interest than blockchain technology.  
As we're all hooked on our smartphones and plugged into the world wide web, all our devices are becoming smarter - from our coffee machine to our washing machine.

With blockchain technology, IoT can scale up securely leaving space for efficient transmission of information.
The challenge in IoT is not about engineering new smart and connected devices - which have popped up at a fast pace for the past decade - but to facilitate **reliable communication channels.**

As John McAfee, cybersecurity entrepreneur and cryptocurrency guru, [very well explained](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=syI9X_uKvUA&list=WL&index=3), the next step is to secure every device connected to the internet - else we're all be very **very** vulnerable to cyber attacks and thefts.

## Crypto can be fair, transparent and egalitarian

Unlike the current central bank system, cryptocurrencies have a transparent, controlled and fixed supply for the public to scrutinise.

Between 1968 and 1973, US President R.Nixon dissolved the dollar's convertibility and ended the Bretton Woods agreement after concerns over dollar overvaluation. 

Till date, currencies are floating freely without any index or commodity backing it.  
Coupled with the introduction of [reserve fractional banking, quantitive easing](../bank-monetary-policy/) and the quadrillion dollar derivative industry, cryptocurrencies provides tangible tools for anyone to scrutinise the crypto-economy.

In the current system, only leaders at central banks and financial institutions have access to public accounts, transaction history and emission rates.

In crypto, you have visibility over both transactions and emission rate.


## Every industry needs disruption, now it's time for banks.

It's no surprise that banks, like any sensible economic agent, will join ship sooner or later.

Some financial institutions have already started to trade cryptocurrency, and even CME, the largest derivatives marketplace,  is planning to launch Bitcoin Futures by mid-December. 

The on-going cryptocurrency market entry is only confined to trading and speculation: retail products related to cryptocurrency are yet to be introduced to the wider audience.

But this won't happen anytime soon. 

Why ?

**Because we don't need banks anymore.**
