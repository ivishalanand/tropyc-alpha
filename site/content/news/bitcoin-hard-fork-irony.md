The final solution to Bitcoin's scaling debate couldn't happen during a closed-doors and invite-only ceremony.

What happens when less than 60 stakeholders force a chain consensus on Bitcoin? 

They abort mission...

Introduced by the Digital Currency Group, the New York Agreement was drafted to reveal that a small group of businesses _finally_ found the solution to the never-ending Bitcoin scaling debate. 
The rich and famous cryptocurrency experts decided to implement two hard forks: one in August (Bitcoin Cash) and another one in November (Bitcoin 2X).  

After the (successful) Bitcoin Cash chain split, Bitcoin faced a potential hard fork in mid-November with the controversial implementation of SegWit 2X. 

It was supposed to be a compromise for users and miners to find common ground: each party would get its own chain.

However, only a few selected and successful organisations have the power to educate (or influence) the general audience about the scaling debate.

In fact, let's be honest, the general audience has a low understanding of the Bitcoin nitty-gritty and especially when it comes to scaling tech.  
People will naturally acknowledge "experts" based on the number of followers on social media, designation in a corporate group or influence over mining infrastructure. 

And when experts clash, like with SegWit1x vs SegWit2x, people take the side of the party with the most compelling arguments.

As such, the scaling debate is **nothing less than a political campaign** within the Bitcoin community about a three letter ticker.  

**The winner gets to decide which chain will be called BTC.**

And just like any political campaign, it comes with a whole lot of irony.

## Initiators of SegWit2X are indecisive flip-floppers

These past six months, we have witnessed organisations continually changing their stand on whether the Segwit2X chain would be considered the _legacy one_. 

Numerous exchanges, wallets, miners and blockchain investment firms stayed vague about which chain would be named BTC, although most of them started the SegWit2X propaganda. 

For instance, CoinBase Communication Director A.Farmer stated they would "call the chain with the most accumulated difficulty Bitcoin" on 25th of October - a couple of weeks before the cancellation.  

This statement can be interpreted in both ways, and does not give any information on which chain would be called "Bitcoin".

On the 8th of November, Digital Currency Groups' companies and other major business services decided to rewind six months earlier and cancel any plans of hard forking the SegWit chain.

## The same people triggered the SegWit2X Futures mania

An invite-only meeting led to the introduction of a **listed derivative** on cryptocurrency exchanges.  
For a month, investors happily traded SegWit2x Futures at a premium price, hoping the fork would happen as planned.

After confirmation of the hard fork "cancellation" initiated first by DCG's CoinDesk, the price of futures dropped by an impressive 86%.

Who is to blame for the introduction of an unregulated security that witnessed price jumps from $600 to $1,800 and then back to $150 in 3 weeks?

Large ticket investors, (some have initiated and cancelled the hard fork) could have liquidated their position before announcing the end of the hard fork via their communication channels.  

It is a classic case of information asymmetry or insider trading where the average cryptocurrency investor cannot compete with the powerhouses.  

## Calling off a hard fork does not make sense

How can we stop a hard fork?

If a handful of miners decide to split the chain and implement SegWit2X, **there will be a second chain no matter what.** 

**Initiators** of the SegWit2X fork decided to cancel it by issuing articles on mainstream cryptocurrency media outlets: CoinDesk, Bitcoin.com or CoinTelegraph.

It all started with a [CoinDesk article](https://www.coindesk.com/2x-called-off-bitcoin-hard-fork-suspended-lack-consensus/) that announced the end of the hard fork via an attached [e-mail](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-segwit2x/2017-November/000685.html) from Mike Belshe, Wences Casares, Jihan Wu, Jeff Garzik, Peter Smith and Erik Voorhees - all historical Bitcoin entrepreneurs.

Releasing such a piece of news has had a massive impact on prices, which could have been leveraged by Segwit2X initiators.  

Launching and calling off the fork in closed doors is similar to a (failed) coup. Here, the key to victory is media control and transmission of information within the community.

This rather odd event reminds us of the following:

* Cryptocurrency media outlets have an agenda, impact prices astronomically, and report to a Bitcoin intelligentsia located at the top of the food chain.
* Bitcoin as a decentralised payment system, has become increasingly politicised and controlled by a handful of early investors and entrepreneurs.
* Bitcoin does need anyone to defend it; you can only defend your own perspective of Bitcoin.
