The final solution to Bitcoin's scaling debate couldn't happen during a closed-doors and invite-only ceremony.

What happens when less than 60 stakeholders force a chain consensus on Bitcoin? 

**They abort mission...**


## Bitcoin intelligentsia found an agreement

Introduced by the Digital Currency Group, the New York Agreement was drafted to reveal that a small group of businesses **finally** found the solution to the never-ending Bitcoin scaling debate.  
The rich and famous cryptocurrency experts decided to implement two hard forks: 

* one in August (Bitcoin Cash)
* another one in November (Bitcoin 2X)

After the (successful) Bitcoin Cash chain split, the second one was supposed to be a compromise between SegWit and a block size increase. As such, each _party_ would get its own chain.

However, let's be honest, the general Bitcoin audience has a low understanding of the technology nitty-gritty, especially when it comes to scaling. Only a selected few organisations have the power to educate (or influence) the general audience about this issue.

Since it is a debate, people will naturally acknowledge "experts" based on the number of followers on social media, designation in a corporate or influence over mining infrastructure. 

And when experts clash, like with SegWit1x vs SegWit2x (developers vs businesses), people take the side of the party with the most compelling arguments.

As such, the scaling debate is **nothing less than a political campaign** within the Bitcoin community, about a three letter ticker.  

**The winner gets to decide which chain will be called BTC.**

And just like any political campaign, it comes with a whole lot of irony.

## Initiators of SegWit2X are indecisive flip-floppers

These past six months, we have witnessed organisations continually changing their stand on whether the Segwit2X chain would be considered the _legacy one_. 

Numerous exchanges, wallets, miners and blockchain investment firms stayed vague about which chain would be named BTC, although most of them started the SegWit2X propaganda. 

For instance, CoinBase Communication Director A.Farmer stated they would "[call the chain with the most accumulated difficulty Bitcoin](https://blog.coinbase.com/clarification-on-the-upcoming-segwit2x-fork-d3c0f545c3e0)" on the 25th of October.

This statement can be interpreted in both ways, and does not give any information on which chain would be called "Bitcoin".

Two weeks after, on the 8th of November, Digital Currency Groups' companies and other major business services decided to rewind six months earlier and cancel any plans of hard forking the SegWit chain. 

## Calling off a hard fork does not make sense

How can we stop a hard fork?

If a handful of miners decide to split the chain and implement SegWit2X, **there will be a second chain no matter what.** 

**The initiators** of the SegWit2X fork decided to cancel it by issuing articles on mainstream cryptocurrency media outlets such as CoinDesk, Bitcoin.com or CoinTelegraph.

It all started with a [CoinDesk article](https://www.coindesk.com/2x-called-off-bitcoin-hard-fork-suspended-lack-consensus/) that announced the end of the hard fork via an attached [e-mail](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-segwit2x/2017-November/000685.html) from Mike Belshe, Wences Casares, Jihan Wu, Jeff Garzik, Peter Smith and Erik Voorhees - all historical Bitcoin entrepreneurs.

Releasing such a piece of news has had a massive impact on prices, which could have been leveraged by Segwit2X initiators.  

Launching and calling off the fork in closed doors is similar to a (failed) coup. Here, the key to victory is media control and transmission of information within the community.

## The same people triggered the SegWit2X Futures mania

An invite-only meeting led to the introduction of a **listed derivative** on cryptocurrency exchanges.  
For a month, investors happily traded SegWit2x Futures at a premium price, hoping the fork would happen as planned.

After confirmation of the hard fork "cancellation" initiated first by DCG's CoinDesk, the price of futures dropped by an impressive 86%.

Who is to blame for the introduction of **an unregulated security** that witnessed price jumps from $600 to $1,800 and then back to $150 in 3 weeks?

Large ticket investors, who have influence over the crypto community, could have liquidated their position before announcing the end of the hard fork via their communication channels.  

Remember: DCG introduced Bitcoin2X and cancelled it via CoinDesk.

In this case, it would be a standard case of information asymmetry, or insider trading, where the average cryptocurrency investor cannot compete with conglomerates. 

This rather odd event reminds us of the following:

* Cryptocurrency media outlets have an agenda, impact prices astronomically, and report to a Bitcoin intelligentsia located at the top of the food chain.
* Bitcoin as a decentralised payment system, has become increasingly politicised and controlled by a handful of early investors and entrepreneurs.
* Bitcoin does need anyone to defend it, one can only defend its own perspective of Bitcoin.
