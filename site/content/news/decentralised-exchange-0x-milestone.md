Decentralised exchanges (DEX) are a critical piece of the crypto-economy infrastructure, that is still (unfortunately) far away from mainstream use.

Today, a majority of blockchain projects, introduced via initial coin offerings, are dependent on the release of DEX before they can launch a working product.

While a wave of "decentralised exchanges" have been released in 2017, only a selected few facilitate such transactions. Just like any other blockchain project, it can get confusing to assess the stage of development, leaving space for product-less tokens in the market.

Last week, one of the leading DEX protocol, 0x, accommodated large scale decentralised exchanges on Radar Relay - reaching a volume of $1 million on the 5th of January and over $10 million on the 9th, <a href=https://0xtracker.com/ target=_blank>as seen on the official tracker</a>.

## What is a decentralised exchange?

Today, cryptocurrency purchasers have to rely on third parties to hold deposits and facilitate the trade of coins and tokens without the need of an intermediary.

Decentralised exchanges, on the other hand, allow users to trustlessly transact amongst each other **without the need to deposit funds into a third party wallet**.  
There are a few decentralised systems with a working product and an active userbase such as EtherDelta, Bisq or OasisDEX.  

However, such platforms have multiple constraints including liquidity, speed or the absence of cross-token trades. Furthermore, these DEXs operate with an order book built on the blockchain, which creates a dependency on block time and leads to higher transaction fees, when compared to centralised exchanges.

New generation DEX plan to relay orders _off-chain_ which will drastically lower speed and cost of an operation. As such, in this scenario, orders would be settled on the blockchain only when required, in order to reduce dependencies to the network. 

Launched in October 2016, 0x intends to solve current market limitations by building a standard protocol for DEX to leverage. It consists of facilitating the exchange of multiple tokens and allows "relayers" (DEX) to create their own exchange platform on top of the 0x protocol.

## 0x is up and running

0x is a protocol for decentralised exchanges; it is, therefore, a business-facing product. However, the team has also introduced a consumer-facing product called "0x OTC", built on top of the protocol. The exchange allows peer-to-peer trade of Ethereum tokens but is only live on the Ethereum **test** network.

While 0x OTC has not been deployed yet, the 0x protocol has reached a significant milestone in the first-week of 2018. 0x' 24-hour volume peaked at $10 million, a massive jump from December's $300,000 per day.

Most of the volume came out of a single exchange: Radar Relay. Furthermore, it is important to underline that ~97% of the trades occurred on SPANK and WETH tokens (WETH is a <a href=https://blog.0xproject.com/canonical-weth-a9aa7d0279dd target=_blank>canonical ERC-20-compliant wrapped ether token</a>)

While $10 million is a drop in the ocean compared to the $45 billion 24-hour volume of the entire crypto-economy, the 0x protocol has pioneered the facilitation of decentralised exchanges.  
Such development is a significant milestone in the design and implementation of a truly decentralised crypto-economy.
