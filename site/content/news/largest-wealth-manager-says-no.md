### Another crypto sceptic amongst banks

UBS AG Group, a Swiss-based financial service company, denied plans to enter the cryptocurrency market anytime soon.  

Mark Haefele, Chief Information Officer (CIO) stated that Bitcoin should not be considered as a viable currency as its size is not even comparable to "the size of some of the smaller currencies".

Considered as the largest private bank [as per Scorpio Partnership research](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-banks-wealth/ubs-retains-positions-as-worlds-biggest-private-bank-study-idUSKCN0ZU030), UBS comes as another sceptic to cryptocurrencies especially after its dramatic price surge in the past year.  
While Bitcoin reached an all-time high later in the day, UBS cannot risk any portfolio allocation because of the absence of regulations, [as Haefele reported to Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-11-17/ubs-shuns-bitcoin-allocations-due-to-threat-of-crypto-crackdown).

>"All it would take would be one terrorist incident in the U.S. funded by bitcoin for the U.S. regulator to much more seriously step in and take action. That’s a risk, an unquantifiable risk, bitcoin has that another currency doesn’t."

UBS joins ranks with other major financial firms, JP Morgan and Credit Suisse to name a few, to avoid any involvement with cryptocurrencies.

### It's the pot calling the kettle black

Money laundering, fraud and terrorism funding are the primary reasons stated to not to start cryptocurrency operations for banks.  

Ironically, in 2015, [the US Treasury Department fined UBS $1.7 million](https://www.thelocal.ch/20150827/us-penalizes-ubs-for-dealing-with-global-terrorist) for handling 222 transactions of an individual blacklisted by the Office of Foreign Assets Control.  
The Swiss Bank was accused of working with a "specially designated global terrorist". It agreed to settle the case.

Yesterday, Swiss financial regulator revealed that JP Morgan broke anti-money laundering rules, [Reuters reported](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-jpmorgan-swiss/swiss-regulator-finds-jpmorgan-broke-money-laundering-rules-idUSKBN1DH1UC).  
Spokesperson stated :

>"In support of that, we have made and continue to make significant enhancements to the firm’s AML (anti-money laundering) program to ensure we are meeting regulatory expectations."

Who knows, maybe blockchain can help?
