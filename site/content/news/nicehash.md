## Another hack

Cloud mining platform NiceHash reported yesterday to have lost more than $64 million worth of Bitcoin.  
The slovenia-based company is a cryptocurrency hashing marketplace that matches miners with individuals looking to purchase computing power.

NiceHash marketing executive Andrej P. Skraba confirmed to Reuters today that hackers compromised their wallets and stole 4,700 bitcoins.

On the 5th of December, the cloud miner stated its service is currently "under maintenance".

The next day, NiceHash released a press release on <a href=https://www.reddit.com/r/NiceHash/comments/7i0s6o/official_press_release_statement_by_nicehash/ target=_blank>/r/NiceHash</a> confirming they were the victim of a cyber attack.



## Could it be an inside job?

We'll most probably never know, but there is always a possibility of faking a hack.  
As such, founding members could have purposely transferred "stolen" funds to a new address and call it a "hack".

Interestingly, co-founder and CTO Matjaz Skorjanc is a convicted criminal arrested by Slovenian Criminal Police with the help of the FBI and Spanish authorities. Under the nickname <a href=https://krebsonsecurity.com/tag/matjaz-skorjanc/ target=_blank>"Iserdo"</a>, Skorjanc built a malicious bot network that infected 12 million computers including major banks and corporations. 

Charges include "racketeering conspiracy; conspiracy to commit wire fraud and bank fraud; conspiracy to commit computer fraud, access device fraud and extortion; and substantive computer fraud"  <a href=https://www.fbi.gov/contact-us/field-offices/pittsburgh/news/press-releases/major-computer-hacking-forum-dismantled target=_blank>as per an FBI press release</a>.  
This information was made public years ago meaning NiceHash users should have been aware of the management team's involvement in global cybercrime.

NiceHash has been a profitable business, earning a handsome fee on mining reward withdrawals since 2014. However, users are the most affected here, as they will most probably not get any payback after such substantial theft.

While the Ljubljana-based company has been supposedly cooperating with local authorities, it is hard to imagine that funds will be found or recovered.

The event comes as another warning to cryptocurrency enthusiasts against the vulnerability of centralised bitcoin companies. 

**Remember: unless you hold the private keys of your digital assets, you do not own any of them.**
