The Bitcoin.org web page released a statement titled "Beware of Bitcoin's possible incompatibility with some major services" on the 11th of October. 
This comes as a new contentious issue between Bitcoin Core and the Digital Currency Group's New York Agreement.  
The article reveals a list of exchanges, wallets and companies that are adopting the controversial Segwit2x hard fork.

It is stated that some businesses belonging to DGC's portfolio "are shifting their users to an alternative currency" without full transparency.

Bitcoin.org have decided not to list major DGC exchanges and products on their [exchange resource page](https://bitcoin.org/en/exchanges), including Coinbase, world's biggest bitcoin exchange. 

Rather, Bitcoin.org is blaming them for manipulating public opinion and forcing the implementation of a "rushed and hasty upgrade which only has minority community support and has been thoroughly rejected by users and the technical community."


## Who owns Bitcoin.org?

The domain was first acquired by Satoshi Nakamoto and Martti Malmi, the first two Bitcoin developers.  
The website was used to publish new versions of Bitcoin Core, the software that runs Bitcoin. 

After 2013, Bitcoin.org became an informative and beginner's platform for any new Bitcoin enthusiasts.  

Today, the website is open-source and managed by Bitcoin Core developers and maintained via pull requests on GitHub.

It is said, that any exchanges and wallets that name the new chain from the NYA "Bitcoin" will be removed from the website's repository.
 

## New York Agreement

On May 23rd, The Digital Currency Group released a [memo](https://medium.com/@DCGco/bitcoin-scaling-agreement-at-consensus-2017-133521fe9a77) stating that Bitcoin companies and miners reached an agreement to "improve" Bitcoin Software.

The agreement stipulated that 58 Bitcoin stakeholders would like to implement SegWit along with an increased block size, from 1Mb to 2Mb. Obviously, the voice of 58 companies does not reflect the opinion of the community.

This agreement has often been depicted as an attempt to control Bitcoin and modify its features to best serve businesses and miners rather than the end users. 

No Bitcoin Core developers ever accepted the proposed changes. 
As such, the New York agreement is often referred to as a joke:

## Hard fork

The intended outcome of the NYA is to double the block size limit by end of October. If so, the Bitcoin chain will split again, creating two Bitcoin blockchains:

* Bitcoin original chain: SegWit.
* Bitcoin new 2x chain: SegWit and increased block size.

Bitcoin.org and Core developers have warned users that many wallets and services owned by the Digital Currency Group are forcing users to consider Bitcoin 2x as the original chain - **which is factually incorrect**.

The press release further warns that: "There is considerable mining power supporting the contentious hard fork."

This can be dangerous for users who do not hold their private key or store them in a mobile wallet.

"Therefore storing any BTC on services such as Coinbase, Bitpay and Xapo is strongly not recommended. By storing BTC on these services, you could find that after the hard fork, your BTC has been renamed to something else or replaced entirely with the new altcoin."


## Warning

Bitcoin.org provided a list of 49 businesses that are promoting the contentious hard fork, including major companies like CoinBase, ShapeShift, Blockchain.info, Jaxx and Bitcoin.com.

If you store your Bitcoin on the referenced exchanges and wallets, your coins might be replaced with a new altcoin currency, implemented forcefully by a selected few players who have major stakes and power in the cryptocurrency industry.

Furthermore, mobile wallet like Jaxx, or blockchain.info should not be considered a safe alternative to exchanges as "most mobile wallets depend on blindly trusting the longest chain produced by the miners [...] therefore the longest chain as seen by most mobile wallets may not be the true blockchain."


## Rivalry

Bitcoin.org also owns the subreddit /bitcoin while Bitcoin.com and /btc is owned and managed by Roger Ver, a Bitcoin early investor and hardcore supporter of increasing the Bitcoin block size.

Evidence also suggests that Roger Ver has been trying to [sabotage the implementation of SegWit](https://medium.com/@WhalePanda/the-curious-relation-between-bitcoin-com-anti-segwit-propaganda-26c877249976).

More than ever, the Bitcoin community is split between two distinct parties :

* Bitcoin.org and the Core Bitcoin team: promotes SegWit without any block size change.
* Bitcoin.com and the Digital Currency Group (CoinDesk, CoinBase etc...) .


Protect yourself against biased media and be sure to fully understand the implications of only following partial media houses such as CoinDesk and Bitcoin.com.
