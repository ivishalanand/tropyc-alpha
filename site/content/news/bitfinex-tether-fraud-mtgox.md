The rise and rise of Bitcoin have placed Bitfinex and Tether under the spotlight.   The infamous collaboration of an unregulated Bitcoin exchange with an unredeemable dollar-backed token may shake up the global crypto-economy, <a href=https://www.tropyc.co/news/summary-bitfinex/ target=_blank>after signs of fraudulent activities</a>.

Can Bitfinex and Tether challenge MtGox's status as the most prominent cryptocurrency meltdown in history?

## Bank and hack issues

British Virgin Islands-based itFinex owns and operates both Bitfinex (exchange) and Tether (digital asset).

The holding incurred:

1. one fine by the US regulator in 2016
2. three hacks of $100mn in combined theft 
3. removal of banking license in the US
4. bank account shut down from Wells Fargo and multiple Asian banks

Today, Bitfinex allegedly shares the same bank account than CEX.io, a polish exchange - under the legal entity Crypto SP.ZO.O.

## Tether has no responsibility

Tether has been marketed as dollar backed digital assets and introduced in most altcoin exchange as "USDT".  
For high-intensity penny altcoin trade, USDT is a quick way to trade on fiat markets, via unregulated exchanges. The token instantly had traction amongst traders because of the ability to enter positions in fiat without any KYC compliance.

Tether's website stipulates the following:

* **100% backed**  
"Every tether is always backed 1-to-1 by traditionnal currency"

* **Transparent**  
"Our reserve are published daily and subject to frequent professional audits"

{{< img src="news/summary-bitfinex2.png" class="img-fluid my-4" alt="Tethers are not monetary instrument as per Tether" >}}  

However, there are contradictions between Tether's marketing campaign and their actions:


* **1) Bitfinex admitted to selling Tether for cryptocurrencies**

Drew, a Bitfinex employee stated on a <a href=http://archive.is/R6sku target=_blank>Reddit thread</a>, that issuance of new Tether "is likely coming from converting other cryptos into USDT".

{{< img src="news/bitfinex-tether-fraud-mtgox4.png" class="img-fluid my-4" alt="These consulting services do not constitute an audit or attestation engagement" >}}  


If Tethers aren't sold for real dollars, but rather for cryptocurrencies, then USDT cannot be 100% backed by USD.

* **2) Tether's legal terms and audits are misleading**

Website terms and conditions state that the company does not guarantee any tokens to be redeemed for money and are not "stored value or currency":

>" There is no contractual right […] against us to redeem or exchange your Tether for money. There is no guarantee against losses when you buy, trade, sell or redeem Tethers.”

Furthermore, Tether's audit conducted by Friedmann LLP is actually ... not an audit, but a memo. Unfortunately, without an audit Tether and Bitfinex can claim to have a one to one USDT to USD ratio.

## Tethers are still being issued

One week after a <a href=https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/21/16684296/tether-cryptocurrency-stolen-30-million-hack target=_blank>30 million USDT hack</a> on the company's main hot wallet, Tether managed to issue more than 100,000,000 USDT.

Today's Tether market capitalisation is reaching an impressive $750 million, up from $450 million by the end of October.

Theoretically, Bitfinex and Tether should have 

* attract investors to pour in $100,000,000 million
* convince them to trust Tether, only days after a major security breach
* route funds to a new bank account, unavailable from public scrutiny

However, Bitfinex admitted to selling Tether for cryptocurrency and not dollars.  
The 1:1 dollar to tether ratio is untrue.  

Issuance of new USDT has become a centralised emission of an unbacked "dollar-backed" virtual currency, by a financial entity with banking restrictions.


## Bitfinex' trade engine crashed

Bitifinex users can margin trade on most crypto/USDT pair.  
Coincidentally, a flash crash occurred during the emission of these 100 million USDT, on multiple markets including Bitcoin, Ether and NEO to name a few.  
It started a series of liquidation among margin traders on Bitfinex.

{{< img src="news/bitfinex-tether-fraud-mtgox2.png" class="img-fluid my-4" alt="NEO went from $40 to $4" >}} 

The price of NEO went from $40 to $4 in a matter of hours.  
A quick glance at <a href=https://www.reddit.com/r/bitfinex/ target=_true>r/Bitfinex</a> will tell you that users aren't happy about it, to say the least.

## Tether's volume is non-sensical

In addition, Tether is supposed to provide "fiat liquidity" to most altcoin exchange including Poloniex and Bittrex.  
Thing is, Tether has been trading at a volume far superior to its market capitalisation.

{{< img src="news/bitfinex-tether-fraud-mtgox3.png" class="img-fluid my-4" alt="Volume is twice as big as market cap" >}}  

On November 30th, Tether's 24-hour volume went up to $1.7 billion, double its market capitalisation.


## How will it stop?

There are allegations, if not evidence, of Bitcoin price manipulation from the Bitfinex Tether clan. As such, <a href=www.twitter.com/bitfinexed target=_blank>Bitfinex'ed</a> has suggested that :

* The USD / USDT pair is being wash traded on Kraken 
* There is a correlation and causation between the issuance of new Tether and the increase in Bitcoin price

{{< youtube 7LlCKQjwmFM >}}

{{< img src="news/summary-bitfinex5.png" class="img-fluid my-4" alt="correlation between ned Tether and bitcoin price jump" >}}  

With increased awareness within the cryptocurrency community and mainstream media, Tether will not be able to continue to issue unbacked tokens in an unregulated environment for long. 

There are many ways how the vicious circle can end, including:

* Regulators step in and shut down operations
* Exchanges delist USDT pairs
* Decrease in value of the digital asset USDT

As long as their operations stay hidden from the regulator, and the market prices remain at par, Tether could virtually keep on printing new tokens unchallenged.
