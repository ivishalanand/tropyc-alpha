Introducing the first edition of our weekly alternative cryptocurrency review, where we describe and compare digitals assets of the same industry.

We hope this review will provide insights to cryptocurrency enthusiasts interested in discovering industry-specific coins and tokens. 

Here, we will be focusing on *digital asset management platforms* that considers tokens and coins as investment vehicles. 

With hedge fund performance declining  by 0.1% on average in November, as per the <a href=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-12-07/hedge-fund-performance-slipped-in-november-as-the-market-rose target=_blank>Hedge Fund Research</a>, blockchain technology offers tangible solutions regarding cost-efficiency and governance

Today, we'll compare four different tokens that intend to disrupt mainstream finance at scale.

(Note that projects are listed in alphabetical order)

## Iconomi 

### Concept

Launched in Slovenia, Iconomi raised $10 million in September via a public initial coin offering on the release of ICN tokens.
At the foundation of Iconomi, sits Digital Asset Arrays (DAA) a combination of several digital assets. As such, asset management can create their own financial products powered by the Iconomi Digital Asset Management Platform, a centralised web application.

1. On the one hand, investors have access to a diversified array of assets, that can be designed by risk adversity or investment style.
2. On the other hand, users can become DAA managers and offer investment opportunities to a wider audience by creating their own array of assets. DAA managers earn fees from the inflow of capital performance of their product.

On the day of writing, Iconomi only offers DAAs built by institutions such as Colombus Capital's Pinta (CCP) and Blockchain Index (BCX)  and is yet to allow "common" users build their own asset array.

### Token

The ICONOMI eco-system offers two types of tokens:

1. ICN, the token of the ICONOMI network are bought back and burned by existing and profitable DAAs. It will have more utility once the DAA platform is finalised: managers will pay inceptions fees in ICN.
2. DAA tokens derive their value from the underlying assets backing the DAA. As such, they are asset-backed.

### Roadmap

* The founding team plans to introduce a fiat gateway exchange to reach an even wider audience within the institutionalised world.
* Deployment of DAA platform for non-institutionalised asset managers.

### Analysis

* **Status**: MVP + Users
* **Pros**: Working product with users
* **Cons**: ICN might pass the Howie test + platform is centralised

## Melon Port

### Concept

Unlike ICONOMI, Mellon is a **decentralised**, blockchain powered, digital asset management protocol. Because it is decentralised, Melon holds technical dependencies to various infrastructure systems such as smart contract development platforms.

Today, Melon Port is built on top of Ethereum, but the founding team announced they intend to convert the protocol blockchain agnostic, meaning Melon should not be exclusive to Ethereum.

The mission resides in facilitating the design, management and operations of decentralised hedge funds. Users can interact with Melon via its Portal, a graphical user interface allowing asset management, investment and redemption.
Smart contracts allow the design of flexible hedge funds with any type of relationships between investors and managers.

As Melon Port is decentralised, users are not required to trust any third party in any hedge fund related process, including the Melon team.

### Token

The MLN token holds two sets of functionalities :

* **Governance**: Holders can both vote on monetary policy and technical design. Regarding the token economy, the founding team has already determined monetary dynamics: users will be able to adjust inflation rate post-launch.
* **Fees**: Transaction and performance fees will be paid or converted in MLN. 

### Roadmap

Oyente, one of Melon' side project, enables smart contract bug reports and programming analysis. The initiative can help Melon mitigate one of its core underlying risk: cybersecurity and faulty smart contracts.
The Melon Protocol and Portal are expected to be deployed on the main network by the first quarter of 2019. 

### Analysis

* **Status**: Pre-MVP, development stage
* **Pros**: Blockchain-powered platform disrupting a multi-billion dollar industry.
* **Cons**: Dependencies to other projects + high cybersecurity risk and exposure to faulty smart contracts
