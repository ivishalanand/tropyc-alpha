Another major bank compared Bitcoin to a Ponzi scheme. 

David Gledhill, chief information officer at DBS, Asia's largest bank, stated that the group sees "bitcoin as a bit of a Ponzi scheme".

## The usual private banks' FUD

First of all, there's no such a thing as "a bit of a Ponzi scheme". Either you're a Ponzi, or you're not - end of the story. 
Second of all, no one who compared Bitcoin to a Ponzi scheme ever explained _why_ it is a Ponzi. 

Maybe because it's not?  
  
Instead, the focus is often on price volatility and access to illicit goods via the deep web.

DBS CIO is hardly the first reputed banking official to spread FUD on the cryptocurrency market, as JP Morgan CEO Dimon said, Bitcoin was "worse than tulip bulbs" and that it "will blow up".

Cryptocurrencies are changing the landscape of financial services, and let's be honest with ourselves; the banking world won't play it fair.

Why?

Blockchain-tech has reduced the transaction fees and costs of access to financial services considerably, creating a substantial threat to established banks.

The same way Expedia disrupted the travel industry, and Uber is changing how we commute; cryptocurrencies will reshape the banking world.

## Public institutions are (a bit) more diplomatic

Financial regulator officials have taken a milder approach with cryptocurrencies.

International Monetary Fund (IMF) director, Christine Lagarde stated: "we should just be aware of not categorizing anything that has to do with digital currencies in those speculation, Ponzi-like schemes".

While some countries have restricted the access to cryptocurrencies or initiated a plan of action to regulate them like China or lately [Iran](https://financialtribune.com/articles/economy-business-and-markets/74533/fate-of-cryptocurrency-in-iran-hangs-in-balance), many have promised more progressive regulation in the near future.

As such, an increasing amount of countries have planned to introduce their own cryptocurrencies including Lebanon, UAE and Estonia, although the latter has been restricted by the European Central Bank.


## Some cryptocurrencies ARE Ponzi schemes

While Bitcoin is not a Ponzi scheme, but rather, the first decentralised financial system with a _terribly unfair_ distribution (before the first Bitcoin media press release in 2010, 3 million coins were already minted).

However, some cryptocurrencies are _proper_ Ponzi schemes.  

Let's talk about BitConnect, the coin without any innovation of such except an aggressive affiliation strategy and marketing campaigns.  
Bitconnect offers 1% daily compounded interest to bag holders - something unsustainable without the injection of fresh capital in the system, as Vitalik Buterin reminded.

On the 14th of November, the UK Registrar of Companies has threatened to shut down Bitconnect operations according to a [press release](https://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/company/10278342/filing-history).   
The Ponzi has two months to prove it's not a Ponzi. Tough task.
