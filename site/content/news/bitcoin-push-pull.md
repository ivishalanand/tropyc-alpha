Bitcoin finally reached the $10,000 price tag, achieving a market capitalisation of $167.5 mn.

What keeps it from going even further?

## PUSH factors

### 1) Crypto is trending 

<script type="text/javascript" src="https://ssl.gstatic.com/trends_nrtr/1225_RC03/embed_loader.js"></script> <script type="text/javascript"> trends.embed.renderExploreWidget("TIMESERIES", {"comparisonItem":[{"keyword":"buy bitcoin","geo":"","time":"today 12-m"},{"keyword":"buy stock","geo":"","time":"today 12-m"},{"keyword":"buy gold","geo":"","time":"today 12-m"}],"category":0,"property":""}, {"exploreQuery":"q=buy%20bitcoin,buy%20stock,buy%20gold&date=today 12-m,today 12-m,today 12-m","guestPath":"https://trends.google.com:443/trends/embed/"}); </script>

**Fact**  

Over the last 12 months, the search term "buy bitcoin" has outperformed "buy stock" and "buy gold", according to Google Trends.  
Historically, "buy bitcoin" was considerably less searched, by more than two-fold.  
In June, "buy bitcoin" levelled up and in October, it finally surpassed stock and gold.

**Analysis**  

Consumer market's interest in cryptocurrencies keeps on growing. New tech-savvy individuals are entering the market en masse.

### 2) Coinbase has more users than Schwab

**Fact**

Bitcoin exchange Coinbase reported 11.7 million client accounts, one million more than second largest brokerage firm by assets, Charles Schwab. 

**Analysis**

Charles Schwab manages trillions of dollars worth of assets but is yet to achieve a crypto-economy-like growth. CoinBase opened 300,000 new accounts in the second week of November, another hint that cryptocurrency market is gaining incredible traction.

### 3) Institutional money is pouring in

**Fact**

CME, the largest derivative exchange, will introduce Bitcoin futures and an index on its platform by year-end.  
Furthermore, a precious metal equity fund, Old Mutual Gold and Silver Fund, has revealed they have been allocating next to 5% of their portfolio on cryptocurrencies.

**Analysis**

Institutional money has _already_ jumped on the cryptocurrency wagon, even those focused on traditional securities.  
With Bitcoin derivatives, corporates will have increased access to short positions.


## PULL factor

### 1) Bitfinex Tether drama

_source: Bitfinex'ed analysis and speculation_

**Fact**

Bitfinex has been outsourcing its access to banking after discrepancies with the regulator and large banking institutions. The same group owns Tether and is suspected to overissue the digital asset without proper reserves.  
<a href = http://archive.is/R6sku target=_blank>Bitfinex employee admitted<a> Tethers are being issued from cryptocurrency and not dollar.

**Analysis**

Discrepancies in centralised peripheral companies of Bitcoin have had an unprecedented impact on prices. When the Mt.Gox scandal hit the streets in 2014, the capitalisation dropped by around 70%.    
As Bitfinex already proved to have security problems in the past, the probability of witnessing another hack or fraud in the short term is significant.

### 2) ICOs have to cash out

{{< img src="news/bitcoin-push-pull4.png" class="img-fluid my-1" alt="ICO raise more money than startups" >}}

**Fact**

The ICO market has been flourishing in the last year, outperforming start-ups regarding fundraising. Although ICOs raise funds via cryptocurrencies, current and future expenses are expected in fiat.

**Analysis**

Companies that went through an ICO round will have to cash out their cryptocurrencies to pay up their bills. As more and more money is injected in this new funding mechanism, it will continuously create a downward price pressure on cryptocurrencies.
