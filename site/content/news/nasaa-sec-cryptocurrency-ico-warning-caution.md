## Regulators consider ICO investment as fraudulent 

As the cryptocurrency market continues to hit the mainstream media headlines, two of US' financial regulators invited investors to stay cautious about the emerging market.

A North American Securities Administrators Association (NASAA) survey showcased that 94% of state and provincial regulators thought there was a "high risk of fraud" in the cryptocurrency market.

NASAA first alerted investors about ICOs and crypto-related investments in 2014 via a <a href=http://www.nasaa.org/44073/nasaa-reminds-investors-approach-cryptocurrencies-initial-coin-offerings-cryptocurrency-related-investment-products-caution/ target=_blank>statement</a> and developed an animated video on the underlying risks of the industry in 2017.

The statement released by NASAA President P. Borg invites investors to "go beyond the headlines and hype to understand the risks associated with investments in cryptocurrencies".

At the same time, the Security Exchange Commission (SEC) issued a <a href=https://www.sec.gov/news/public-statement/statement-clayton-stein-piwowar-010418 target=_blank>press release</a> backing NASAA's statement and added that cryptocurrencies "lack many important characteristics of traditional currencies, including sovereign backing and responsibility".

More importantly, the SEC reminded investors that ICO promoters are selling securities that are not following state and federal law:

> "The SEC and state securities regulators are pursuing violations." 

## Concerns and red flags of fraud

The NASAA shared a five cryptocurrency concerns along with five red flags that are signs of fraud.

### Concerns

* Cybersecurity and hack risks for holders
* No insurance by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation
* Price volatility unsuitable for most investors
* Coins and tokens are reliant upon unregulated organisations
* Investors are dependent on third-party devices to protect their assets from theft

### Red flags

* Guaranteed return on investment
* Cold calling and unsolicited offers
* Too good to be true
* Pressure to purchase immediately
* Unlicensed organisations

## Upcoming regulation?

Statements of two of US' most prominent regulator is indicative of an increasing focus by the government towards the cryptocurrency market in general. 

As the industry continues to grow and hit new milestones, cryptocurrencies should attract even more newcomers and fresh capital. Uneducated investors are at the mercy of fraud or theft: such scenario will likely trigger a wave of regulations throughout the world.
