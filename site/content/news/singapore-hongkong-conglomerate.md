During the Singapore Fintech Festival, members of Singapore and Hong Kong central banks have announced the creation of a blockchain partnership between twenty-odd banks, according to the [Business Times](http://www.businesstimes.com.sg/government-economy/20-banks-likely-to-join-frenemy-trade-pact-between-hong-kong-and-singapore).

Promoted by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (financial regulator), the Global Trade Connectivity Network will introduce new interbank partnerships by 2019.  
The multi-trillion conglomerate is expected to leverage distributed ledger technology to streamline banking settlement and data transmission.

Distributed ledger technology and blockchain trade network has witnessed tremendous growth after the aggressive expansion of the Ripple network [which recently partnered with American express](http://fortune.com/2017/11/16/amex-payments-ripple-blockchain/).

The initiative comes as a new landmark in the Singapore and Honk Kong competitive yet fruitful relationship.  
Both hubs are considered financial giants in the region and compete to attract investment and talent. 

Wenda Ma, a member at the Hong Kong Trade Development Council, sums up well the situation: "Rather than a zero-sum game, Hong Kong and Singapore may complement each other in many ways that could contribute to the prosperity of the region."
