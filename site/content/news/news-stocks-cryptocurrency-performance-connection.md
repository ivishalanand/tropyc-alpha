The cryptocurrency market has reached a new milestone this year, stepping one foot into the realm of mainstream finance, after the introduction of Bitcoin futures contracts in major derivatives marketplace.

Institutionalised investors are gaining interest in the market, although it has often been labelled as a "get rich quickly" scheme.  

Now that financial institutions have an eye on this alternative market, especially after <a href= http://fortune.com/2017/12/14/bloomberg-ethereum/ target=_blank>Bloomberg launched them on its terminal</a>, *can a cryptocurrency price crash impact the stock and bond market?*

## Portfolio diversification creates a sell pressure

For now, most newcomers are focused on established cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, Litecoin, Ether and Ripple to name a few. As such, smaller capitalisation digital assets including infrastructure tokens (distributed computing, decentralised exchange, collective storage) are not under the spotlight yet.

Investors looking to diversify their portfolio or enter new positions into riskier and less known cryptocurrencies should most probably sell their existing stocks and financial instruments from regulated and more traditional markets, rather than merely injecting fresh money into the system.

Theoretically, a correlation between the increasing interest for cryptocurrency and a sell pressure on conventionnal markets should exist, since asset diversification starts with selling products for cash.

Wells Fargo's equity strategy division head implied such scenario is highly probable <a href=https://www.cnbc.com/2017/12/23/a-bitcoin-implosion-could-spill-over-into-stocks-warns-wells-fargo.html target=_blank>on a CNBC show</a>: "there is a significant amount of froth in the cryptomarkets. We do think that if that froth comes out, it will start to spillover".

## Cryptocurrency valuation is a drop in the ocean

Well, this just a "theory", because turns out the cryptocurrency market capitalisation is worth peanuts compared to the global finance market.

Sure, Bitcoin reached an impressive all-time high, topping $20,000 per unit and leading our industry to a $600 billion market capitalisation. But the gold market capitalisation is worth at $7.2 trillion, as per Thomson Reutersâ€™ GFMS Gold survey 2017; this is twelve times more than cryptocurrencies.

To put things in more perspective, Apple is valued at $880 billion, and the derivatives market is estimated (on the higher end) at $1.2 quadrillion.

Even if an increased interest in cryptocurrency leads to a selling pressure on stock markets, the "influence" would be minimal as both market sizes are drastically different.

## A new hedge

Interestingly, cryptocurrency and conventional financial markets have become complementary. Since the crypto-economy is an alternative to our banking system, cryptocurrencies are hedging tools against traditional securities and vice-versa.

Taking a step back, the introduction of cryptocurrency related derivatives on regulated markets has created two mutually exclusive and collaboratively exhaustive investment environment for institutions. How both economies will perform against each other is yet to be observed, but it is certain that one environment is a hedge against the other.
