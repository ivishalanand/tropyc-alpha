Last month, JP Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon stated Bitcoin might just be "a fraud" and "is worse than tulip bulbs." He further said that he would "fire in a second" any JP Morgan employees that would trade Bitcoin because it would be "stupid".

Criticism from America's leading investment bank has made the price of cryptocurrencies plumb but it quickly recovered weeks after the event.

Goldman Sachs, another heavyweight in modern banking appears to take a whole different position on Bitcoin according to the [Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/articles/goldman-sachs-explores-a-new-world-trading-bitcoin-1506959128). As such, according to the rumour, Goldman Sachs is considering opening a trading office focused on cryptocurrencies in order to cater the increasing market demand from institutionalised clients. 

If it is confirms, Goldman Sachs would become the first major financial institution to be directly involved in cryptocurrency investments.

Most established banks have been reluctant to the idea of introducing cryptocurrency focused services, mainly because of a lack of comprehensive regulatory frameworks and the danger cryptocurrencies represent to the banking world.

As such, in crypto, you are your own bank.

Opening cryptocurrency operations could mean the issuance of a wide range of services, including:

* Introduction of derivatives or Exchange Traded Funds.
* Facilitation of Over The Counter markets.
* Storage of cryptocurrencies and assets.

"In response to client interest in digital currencies, we are exploring how best to serve them in this space" reported a Goldman Sachs spokesperson. 

Morgan Stanley, another leading bank, also followed the same route as Goldman Sachs: rather than bashing cryptocurrencies like JP Morgan's CEO, Morgan Stanley's CEO came out in defence of bitcoin stating it was "more than just a fad".

Fidelity Investments, one of the largest US-based retail investment house, integrated cryptocurrency tracking with Coinbase later in the year. 

Most of the major financial institutions already tested the implementation of blockchain technology with R3.  
R3 offers a distributed yet centralised ledger to a consortium of global banks including JP Morgan, Barclay's, UBS and Deutsche Bank.    
However, Goldman Sachs has bailed out the project in late 2016 without any extensive explanation.

If the rumour published by NASDAQ and WSJ turns out to be true, it could be a major leap forward for the cryptocurrency market, especially in terms of liquidity and trade volume.

In fact, it is very likely that other financial institutions would open cryptocurrency operations if Goldman Sachs decides to enter the market - everyone will want a piece of the cake.

An increasing amount of institutions would be able to trade on cryptocurrency markets, injecting a large amount of fresh capital. That being said, such market movement could lead to even more price volatility, something most banks and regulators still fear.

This comes in the middle of positive US regulations and policies on cryptocurrency trading.  
While the SEC did reject Winklevoss brother's Bitcoin ETF proposal in Q2 2017, a Bitcoin future contract should be listed on the Chicago Board Options Exchange by the end of the year.  
Furthermore, U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) licenced LedgerX to facilitate trade and exchange of cryptocurrency derivatives.
