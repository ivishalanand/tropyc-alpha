Last summer, the Initial Coin Offering fundraising model hit mainstream success thanks to impressive, if not obscene, project valuations.
Fast forwarding to December, the ICO hype has cooled off after reports of legal issues for $200 million Tezos and poor market performance for $154 million Bancor.

Over six months, the ICO success rate plummeted from 50% to less than 20% according to tokendata.io. Projects find it hard to meet their valuation target as market concentration increases and demand stagnates.

## Fierce competition

The ICO eco-system remains immature, although a staggering growth rate that outperforms start-up seed investment.
ICO investors do not seem to focus enough on the release of Minimum Viable Product or achievement of product-market fit. This phenomenon leads to sometimes absurd scenarios where an ICO without any prototype can raise considerable amounts of funds while some with a working product and a validated model struggle to raise cash.

With the emergence of extensive documentation and smart contract development libraries, less tech-savvy talent have all the means to conceptualise, set up and launch a successful ICO.
It results in a scenario where most of today's ICOs have no MVP, prototype or validation.  
Instead of focusing on product development, many projects allocate their resources into a building a trustworthy environment for investors by designing appealing web application's visual experiences, providing 24/7 chat support via instant chat or incentivising community affiliation.

ICOs with attractive aesthetics, original visual experiences and outstanding community relations tend to attract most investment.

## Targeting whales rather than a broader audience?

Market dynamics have shifted drastically in the past couple of months:

* ICO supply has increased creating a highly competitive landscape.
* Established cryptocurrency have witnessed impressive returns, diluting ICO return on investment rate.
* Web design and community support appear to be as important as the stage of product development for investors.

No matter what, ICOs cannot expect capital to come "passively" like before, but rather to actively seek an audience in line with the project's mission and vision, whether they are thousands of investors or a handful of high net worth cryptocurrency hodlers.

To do so, projects have to implement marketing strategies focusing on collective investment pools or institutionalised investors, but their respective needs drastically differ. Institutions expect face to face interactions, while collective pools require a 24/7 chat service.

The means to attract investment from large funds are more conventional than targeting smaller ticket-size investors who sometimes act more emotionally than logically.

## First come first serve

An ICO investor is before anything a _cryptocurrency_ investor. 

Therefore ICOs are competing with :

* Established digital assets and cryptocurrencies.
* ICOs that closed a fundraising round and are listed on exchanges.

The increased attention towards the "captains of crypto", Bitcoin, Litecoin, and Ripple to name a few, has undoubtedly negatively impacted ICO investment as a whole.

The sudden rise in Bitcoin price creates a sell pressure on every altcoin, including freshly liquid ICOs. As the capitalisation of Bitcoin increases, altcoins saw their BTC capitalisation shrink at impressive rates. 

The dilution may have created a risk-averse environment amongst investors: why invest in ICOs if hodling major cryptocurrencies result in unprecedented returns? 

ICOs that occurred before last month's price pump have made handsome profits from their initial investment. The increment reduces cash constraints for them but creates an even more competitive landscape for future ICOs.

Upcoming projects have to communicate their value proposition effectively to a targeted audience and remain flexible to investor's communication expactations.  
Long gone are the days where investors are merely looking to "flip" their tokens once ICO hit the exchange.
