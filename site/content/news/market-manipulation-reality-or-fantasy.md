The impressive rise of the cryptocurrency market capitalisation followed by a dramatic correction has left newcomers shocked about price volatility.  
50% price swings over a short period (weeks if not days) aren't uncommon for experienced market watchers and crypto enthusiasts.

After the rapidly increasing awareness of cryptocurrency to mainstream media, regulators and institutionalised investors, many have suggested that the market is heavily manipulated, if not controlled by a handful of stakeholders. 

*Can these allegations turn out to be true?*  

Let's review some facts surrounding the potential existence of artificial inflation or deflation of established digital assets.

## The market is unregulated

"It's the wild west", says Mike Novogratz, a billionaire hedge fund manager in cryptocurrency.   
From digital assets themselves to marketplaces where you can trade them, none of the cryptocurrency and blockchain industry is regulated.  

On one side, investors aren't aware of how Securities Law applies to many crypto assets and how it can negatively impact their liquidity and price tags.  
On the other hand, a considerable chunk of trades occur on centralised and unregulated exchanges, all at the mercy cyber attacks, insider fraud and theft.

<a href=https://www.tropyc.co/news/bitfinex-tether-ticking-bomber/ target=_blank>How one exchange issued security and dollar-pegged tokens even after several hacks</a>, showcases the absence of any market regulation and therefore ... investor protection.


## Exchanges act just like banks

Conventional financial institutions leverage fractional reserve banking: the practice of undertaking banking services, such as accepting deposits and issuing loans, but with the requirement of only holding reserves equal to a fraction of its depositary obligations.  
In other words, banks are not able to disburse the funds of all of their depositors at the same time.

Cryptocurrency and blockchain technology acts as an alternative to fractional reserve banking and quantitative easing (the act of issuing an unlimited amount of cash).  
As such, you cannot “double spend” crypto assets, and most of them follow a <a href=https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Controlled_supply target=_blank>controlled supply</a> with a transparent emission rate.  

Exchanges are centralised entities that facilitate the trade between the cryptocurrency and the fiat world. The price tag of a crypto asset is therefore settled between peers on exchanges. On top of that, exchanges have introduced derivatives and lending tools on their platform. With depositors storing their crypto-capital on exchanges, this new kind of crypto financial institutions hold opaque reserves and can sometimes delay disbursement to their clients.

Today, as depositors store their assets on exchanges, there is no proof that these intermediaries are not undertaking fractional reserve banking. If every cryptocurrency investors withdraw all their assets at the same time, it is not said that exchanges hold enough liquidity for everyone.

## Listing a coin impacts its price tag

Last week, <a href=https://support.coinbase.com/customer/portal/articles/2853600-bitcoin-cash---frequently-asked-questions target=_blank>Coinbase introduced Bitcoin Cash (BCH)</a> to its trading platform adding the controversial Bitcoin fork to their listed coins: BTC, LTC and ETH. Since August, the Bitcoin community is debating over which coin, BTC or BCH is the true Bitcoin.  
Thing is, BCH has never been considered as the original chain by the majority of the community. So when Coinbase, the leading Bitcoin exchange, introduces BCH and triggers a trading price of $9,000 - $6,000  more than the market price, it raises many eyebrows.  
After a severe correction, BCH has been trading at a 25% premium.

Coinbase felt obliged to stall trading operations when a wave of critics called for “insider trading” within one of Digital Currency Group’s (DCG) flagship company. At the same time, BTC dropped sharply, reducing the market capitalisation gap between both chains. This can come across as shady, since DCG orchestrated the Bitcoin Cash chain split during the New York Agreement in May.

Introducing new crypto assets on exchanges improves awareness and market penetration of any given coin or token. By merely adding them to their crypto list, exchanges have a tremendous impact on the price tag, liquidity and market capitalisation of any digital assets.

## Social media: influencers and traders play a shady game

There are thousands of cryptocurrencies out there, and most of them might not provide any tangible utility or are merely copycats of more established projects.  
As the cryptocurrency market remains somewhat niche within the investment community, freshly minted tokens and coins have to attract cryptocurrency enthusiasts to build a valuable network.  
Just like any other project, cryptocurrency’s founding team undertake extensive marketing and communication campaigns especially on mainstream social media and with the help of influencers.  

John McAfee, a cybersecurity pioneer, started promoting one coin or token every day via his Twitter account.  On the 23rd of December, McAfee promoted Digibyte which triggered an impressive 120% jump in just 12 hours … with 53% occurring in only half an hour.

Influencers have the opportunity to promote a cryptocurrency to millions of individuals, impacting directly the price of an asset. Theoretically, any influencer could purchase a digital asset before promoting it, to gain handsome profits after the communication stunt. 

The rule applies to any social media promotion, whether it is through public Facebook groups, Telegram channels or via paid trade signal services. Some individuals are way more straighforward on the matter, naming their groups "pump & dump".

## Whales own most the crypto out there

Owners of massive amounts of cryptocurrency are known as “whales”, investors holding an (extremely) large position in crypto.  
For instance, on November 12th, a holder moved 25,000 BTC to an exchange wallet – at the time it was worth $160 million.  

According to Aaron Brown, former managing director at AQR Capital Management, 40% of Bitcoin are perhaps held by 1,000 users. Kyle Samani, managing partner at Multicoin Capital, thinks there are a few hundred individuals that own a large proportion of Bitcoin and "they all probably can call each other, and they probably have".

The level of concentration may lead to artificial price variations where such whales can coordinate and orchestrate a buy or a sell market run.

> “As in any asset class, large individual holders and large institutional holders can and do collude to manipulate price. In cryptocurrency, such manipulation is extreme because of the youth of these markets and the speculative nature of the assets." Ari Paul, co-founder BlockTower Capital

Due to its relatively young age, the cryptocurrency market is manipulated in several ways, especially since it is unregulated.  
But the concept of manipulation should be relative and compared to conventional markets. Thinking stock and bond markets are not manipulated could come across, let's be honest, as naïve.
