The cryptocurrency market has reached another milestone in the past week.  
While achieving a new Bitcoin all-time high always feels a bit special; unfortunately, we're not referring to price hikes but to another hack.

And this one seems a bit different as it reveals a series of unregulated financial operations by an industry leader.

## Complicated financial life

On November 19th, USD Tether (USDT) <a href="https://tether.to/tether-critical-announcement" target="_blank">announced that they were the victim of a 30 million USDT theft</a>.

"They" refers to itFinex, a British Virgin Island (BVI) based holding that owns and operates

* Bitfinex, the largest cryptocurrency exchange by volume
* Tether Limited, the company that manages the issuance of USDT

Regarding exchange operations, Bitfinex has stalled their USD deposits and withdrawals from US citizens, after complications with the American regulator and intermediary banks, earlier this year.

As such, the <a href="http://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/pr7380-16" target="_blank">Commodity Futures Trading Commission fined Bitfinex in 2016</a> for "offering illegal off-exchange financed retail commodity transactions".

Although it is the world's largest Bitcoin trading exchange, Bitfinex is unregulated and appears to be one of the most vulnerable financial marketplaces in the world.

## Consistency: one hack every year

It is not the first time itFinex lost money due to hacking; they already lost 1,500BTC in 2015 ($0.33 mn at the time) 120,000 BTC in 2016 ($72 mn at the time).  

itFinex has been remarkably consistent, and managed to get hacked once per year.  
At today's rate, stolen Bitcoins are valued at $1 billion.

Concerns over exchange hacks are nothing new, especially after the Mt.Gox case back in 2014.  
Here, the situation appears to be very different, as Bitfinex successfully introduced two tokens:

1. BFX - an IOU turned equity token
2. USDT - an asset-backed token

## BFX Token - forcing victims to become shareholders

After the 2016 hack, the company decided controversially to distribute the losses amongst customers, impacting their portfolio with a 36 percent loss.  
To repay their customers, the company entered a confusing (and tokenised) adventure:

1. Bitfinex issued 72 million tokens named "BFX Token", an IOU priced at $1 per unit.

2. Bitfinex convinced users to convert BFX Tokens for equity in itFinex, the mother company based in BVI.

3. 20 million tokens were successfully traded for equity by October 2016. The decision to set a $200 million valuation remained opaque and at the discretion of itFinex's upper management.

4. The management team, including Chief Financial Officer, Giancarlo Devasini stated that the fastest way to recover losses from the hack, was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZR0NCwy7yeo" target="_blank">"to convert BFX into equity and (to) sell them to another investor"</a>.

5. Bitfinex <a href="https://www.bitfinex.com/posts/198" target="_blank">successfully announces redemption of outstanding BFX Tokens</a> in April 2017.  
For nearly 18 months, Bitfinex users were able to trade, exchange, <b>lend and margin trade</b> the BFX token.

In other words, Bitfinex lost funds after an attack, impacted it on their customers, forced them to become shareholders of their company, and introduced a leveraged market on the token.

## USDT - dollar redeemable token (that cannot be redeemed)

Although Tether is marketed as a 1:1 dollar backed token, USDT token holders cannot redeem USD from a Tether token on the primary market.

As per Tether's website, USDTs "are not money and [...] monetary instrument. There is no contractual right [...] against us to redeem or exchange your Tether for money". 

The only way for investors to swap USDT to fiat, is on the secondary market:

* Convert USDT to USD on Kraken - (only exchange with the pair and banking facilities.) 
* Convert USDT to a cryptocurrency and then cash out to fiat.

Since Bitfinex does not have access to banking, its USDT/USD pair is worthless for investors interested in cashing out their Tether.

Bitfinex'ed, a cryptocurrency reporter and whistleblower, has scrutinised the Tether Audit <a href="https://medium.com/@bitfinexed/the-so-called-tether-audit-that-isnt-an-audit-at-all-5a40cfcc2a75" target="_blank">here</a>.
According to him/her, it should not be considered as an "audit" because of numerous clauses and how it is phrased.

The USDT/USD pair has remained at par, even after numerous allegations of unregulated operations with media coverages, including on the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/21/technology/bitcoin-bitfinex-tether.html" target="_blank">NY Times</a>.

It is important to note that the issuance of Tether has increased drastically in the last couple of months. Supply has jumped three fold, from USDT 220 million to 675 million between July and November 2017.

## Regulator will come knocking on the door - but where?

Bitfinex has been in the eye of American financial regulators after the issuance of these two tokens as its banking licence was revoked earlier this year.  
Shortly after the full redemption of BFX token, finance giant Wells Fargo prohibited the completion of international wire transfers from four Taiwan-based banks.  

The exchange issued a lawsuit and withdrew it a week afterwards. Days after, Bitfinex was shut down from Taiwanese banks.  
Since then, Bitfinex has been switching banks without letting its customers know where and how the money was stored.

Bitfinex has recently resumed deposit/withdrawal operations in USD(T?) and introduced EUR(T?) to its users - however, it does not accept any US Citizen as clients.  

There are allegations that Bitfinex is currently "sharing" their bank account with CEX.io, a cloud miner turned exchange (learn why cloud miner are fraudulent schemes <a href="www.tropyc.co/crypto-101/invest/scams" target="_blank">here</a>).

Bitfinex'ed has collected information on one of his twitter threads that Bitfinex might "outsource" access to banking via a Panama-based corporation, <a href="https://cryptocapital.co/" target="_blank">Crypto Capital</a>, that owns at 99% "CRYPTO SP.ZO.O" the holder of the depositor accounts.

Now more than ever, we should read over and over again Nick Szabo's quote on secure financial networks:

>"Bitcoin is the most secure financial network on the planet. But its centralized peripheral companies are among the most insecure."
