Many have stated that Bitcoin reaching an all-time high above $10,000 is the sign of a new transitional period for the cryptocurrency market. 
Have cryptocurrencies become mainstream?

Short answer: No

## Half a percent of global population owns a cryptocurrency

Total number of Bitcoin users is estimated to be around 45 million according to the <a href=https://www.jbs.cam.ac.uk/fileadmin/user_upload/research/centres/alternative-finance/downloads/2017-global-cryptocurrency-benchmarking-study.pdf target=_blank>Global cryptocurrency benchmarking</a>, by the Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance

The research combined non-public "off-chain" data from more than 150 businesses related to the cryptocurrency market. 
Therefore, cryptocurrency holders represent less than 0.6% of the global population.


## Market capitalisation is peanuts

With Bitcoin reaching a price tag of $11,000, the combined cryptocurrency market capitalisation is approximately at $320 billion, while gold is sitting at $7.2 trillion as per Thomson Reuters' GFMS Gold survey 2017.  
The "digital gold" represents less than 5% of gold's value.

To put things in more perspective, Bitcoin market capitalisation is only 76% of Apple's $250 billion cash reserve and 0.015% of the $1.2 quadrillion derivative market.

## Experience is still unpleasant

Bitcoin has grown as a more stable technology with increased accessibility to non-technical profiles. For instance, ATMs are popping up in urban hubs, cold storage wallet are affordable, and most of the software has implemented Graphical User Interface (GUI).

However, the experience of "being your own bank" can get confusing, especially for new entrants in the market.  
Hard forks, ICOs, smart contracts consist of a terminology that needs time for the masses to comprehend.
Furthermore, decentralised applications are still at an early stage of development, without any functional use case with global traction.

## Today's crypto is the 90s of internet

>"Ultimately, it took more than 30 years for TCP/IP to move through all the phases - single use, localised use, substitution and transformation - and reshape the economy"

The four-step phase comparison between blockchain and TCP/IP explained by Harvard professors Marco Iansiti and Karim Lakhani can be illustrated as follows:

According to the framework from "The truth about blockchain", the cryptocurrency market is currently at the second stage.

Many use cases for cryptocurrency have been presented in the last twelve months, but are "too early" for their time. Before cryptocurrency turns into the "2000s era", there are four main barriers to mass adoption:

* **Social acceptance**: the people need to understand the technology, consider it superior to the current one, and adopt it in their day to day life.
* **Regulation**: the shift should also be political and societal, where public institutions will have to consider cryptocurrency in the existing legal framework.
* **Technical standards**: smart contracts and decentralised applications have no on-boarding standards, maintenance protocols and struggle to achieve organisational transformation at scale.
* **Infrastructure**: the market has drastically matured in the last years, but there is still insufficient infrastructure for it to go to the next level. <a href=https://medium.com/@FEhrsam/the-dapp-developer-stack-the-blockchain-industry-barometer-8d55ec1c7d4 target=_blank>Scalable computation, file storage and external data</a> are amongst the domain falling behind in terms of development.

To summarise, a price tag should not define the level of market adoption.
