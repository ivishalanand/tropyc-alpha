Edward Snowden cannot be always right.

The famous NSA whistle-blower, Edward Snowden, started a massive debate amongst the cryptocurrency community when assessing two of the most popular privacy-focused tokens: ZCash and Monero

It all started when he tweet this bomb:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Agree. Zcash&#39;s privacy tech makes it the most interesting Bitcoin alternative. Bitcoin is great, but &quot;if it&#39;s not private, it&#39;s not safe.&quot; <a href="https://t.co/HqwQOvSCiz">https://t.co/HqwQOvSCiz</a></p>&mdash; Edward Snowden (@Snowden) <a href="https://twitter.com/Snowden/status/913544739542241282?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 28, 2017</a></blockquote>

In response to a tweet from Mason Borda which read: "Zcash is the only altcoin (that i know of) designed and built by professional and academic cryptographers. Hard to ignore," Snowden suggested ZCash is the “most interesting Bitcoin alternative.”

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none" data-cards="hidden" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Great project, but the problem with amateur crypto is mistakes happen and have huge consequences for people like me: <a href="https://t.co/upyXId1Ubh">https://t.co/upyXId1Ubh</a></p>&mdash; Edward Snowden (@Snowden) <a href="https://twitter.com/Snowden/status/913557610858778625?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 29, 2017</a></blockquote>

On the same thread, Snowden further praised ZCash indirectly by qualifying Monero, ZCash’s main rival, as a “great project” but “amateur crypto” along with an article from CoinDesk. This comes as rather suspicious because CoinDesk is owned by the Digital Currency Group, a fund that has stake in ZCash Company, the private firm that operates ZCash.

Overal, this communication reveals multiple red flags:

*	Snowden is not up to date.

Monero has been constantly improving their software to improve their privacy features. It has been disclosed in 2015 by the (Monero Research Lab) [] that limitations existed concerning anonymity on their blockchain.
Interestingly, members of the board of the ZCash Foundation published an academic paper in 2017 reminding the vulnerabilities of Monero’s previous 2015 features on (MoneroLink) [http://monerolink.com/monerolink.pdf]. 
Mind that this website is run by ZCash stakeholders and has been promoted by CoinDesk and the Digital Currency Group.
Monero’s vulnerabilities have been addressed by the team till date. Back in 2015, Monero had only a few users and openly communicated about transaction linking discrepancies. 

*	Monero is nothing but amateur.

Achieving anonymity in cryptocurrency is nothing but static and requires constant updates and improvement. Stating that a cryptocurrency has the best privacy features should be relative to the other existing solutions.
While Monero should always keep on improving its solution, it is one of the best performing tokens in the market and therefore is nothing but amateur but rather paving the way for further improvement in this exciting space. 

*	A private company runs ZCash.

ZCash has been introduced by a private firm ZCash Company, on the other hand, Monero is launched by a community of developers.  
ZCash can be subpoenaed by the US government while Monero cannot. A for-profit corporation does not seem fit to the decentralisation drive that blockchain technology is introducing.

*	Snowden did not address any of ZCash core issues.

**	Compared to Monero, ZCash token fundamentals are less attractive for enthusiasts. As such, miners are taxed with a 20% fee from mining rewards disbursed to the founders for the next 4 years. 
**	Furthermore, ZCash was set-up in closed doors in a trusted setup. This means ZCash blockchain is vulnerable to a back door if the genesis block private key was not destroyed as advertised. ZCash token holders will always have to trust the founder that nothing adverse happened during the token introduction, without any hard evidence to prove it. In other words, there is no guarantee the US government has a backdoor. 

*	CoinDesk and ZCash are owned by the same fund.

The Digital Currency Group has a stake in both the cryptocurrency ZCash and the media outlet CoinDesk. CoinDesk has therefore an agenda to promote ZCash against its main competition Monero.
Here, Snowden linked a CoinDesk article to both promote ZCash’s tech features and qualify Monero as “amateur” crypto. Further to that the Monero vulnerabilities stated in the article are outdated.
Snowden promotes an obvious conflict of interest that reveals his lack of research. 

Snowden has been undeniably a pioneer in whistleblowing privacy and security breaches for the average internet users. However, his open endorsement to a ZCash while bashing Monero with a link to a biased media is very controversial and might suggest Snowden’s is not up to date with cryptocurrency technology or has an agenda promote Digital Currency Group’s products and services. 
This might just jeopardize Snowden’s credibility as a security expert… at least in the cryptocurrency space.

FYI: Litecoin’s founder Charlie Lee owns Monero and not ZCash
