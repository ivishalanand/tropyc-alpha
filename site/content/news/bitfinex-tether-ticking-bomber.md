The rise of Bitcoin has placed Bitfinex and Tether under the spotlight. The infamous collaboration of an unregulated Bitcoin exchange with an unredeemable dollar-backed token may shake up the global (crypto) economy, <a href=https://www.tropyc.co/news/summary-bitfinex/ target=_blank>after signs of fraudulent activities</a>.

Can Bitfinex and Tether challenge MtGox's status as the most prominent cryptocurrency meltdown in history?

## Bank and hack issues

British Virgin Islands-based itFinex owns and operates both Bitfinex (exchange) and Tether (digital asset).

The holding incurred:

1. one fine by the US regulator in 2016
2. three hacks of $100mn in combined theft 
3. removal of banking license in the US
4. bank account shut down from Wells Fargo and multiple Asian banks

Today, Bitfinex allegedly shares its bank account with CEX.io, a polish exchange - under the legal entity "Crypto SP.ZO.O."

## Tether's reserve aren't fully backed

Marketed as a dollar backed digital asset and introduced in most altcoin exchanges as "USDT", Tether promises a 1:1 ratio with USD.
At its core, Tether makes it easy for traders to switch from fiat to crypto markets on unregulated exchanges. It instantly had traction amongst traders because it gives them the ability to enter positions in fiat without any KYC compliance.

Tether's marketing content stipulates the following:

* **100% backed**  
"Every tether is always backed 1-to-1 by traditionnal currency"

* **Transparent**  
"Our reserve holdings are published daily and subject to frequent professional audits"

{{< img src="news/summary-bitfinex2.png" class="img-fluid my-4" alt="Tethers are not monetary instrument as per Tether" >}}  

However, there are contradictions between Tether's marketing campaign and their actions:


* **1) Bitfinex admitted to selling Tether for cryptocurrencies**

Drew, a Bitfinex employee stated on a <a href=http://archive.is/R6sku target=_blank>Reddit thread</a>, that issuance of new Tether "is likely coming from converting other cryptos into USDT".

{{< img src="news/bitfinex-tether-fraud-mtgox4.png" class="img-fluid my-4" alt="These consulting services do not constitute an audit or attestation engagement" >}}  

If Tethers aren't sold for real dollars, but rather for cryptocurrencies, then USDT cannot be 100% backed by USD.

* **2) Tether's legal terms and audits are misleading**

Website terms and conditions state that the company does not guarantee any tokens to be redeemed for money and are not "stored value or currency":

>" There is no contractual right […] against us to redeem or exchange your Tether for money. There is no guarantee against losses when you buy, trade, sell or redeem Tethers.”

Furthermore, Tether's audit conducted by Friedmann LLP is actually a memo according to a <a href=https://twitter.com/TuurDemeester/status/914226805506179073 target="_true">twitter influencer</a>. Without an audit Tether and Bitfinex can claim to have a one to one USDT to USD ratio. 

{{< img src="news/bitfinex-tether-fraud-mtgox1.png" class="img-fluid my-4" alt="These consulting services do not constitute an audit or attestation engagement" >}}  


## Tethers are still being issued

One week after a <a href=https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/21/16684296/tether-cryptocurrency-stolen-30-million-hack target=_blank>30 million USDT hack</a> on the company's main hot wallet, Tether managed to issue more than 100,000,000 USDT.

Today's Tether market capitalisation is reaching an impressive $750 million, up from $450 million by the end of October.

Theoretically, Bitfinex and Tether should have 

* attracted investors to pour in $100,000,000
* convinced them to trust Tether, only days after a major security breach
* routed funds to a new bank account, unavailable from public scrutiny

This was supposed to be the case, until Bitfinex admitted to selling Tether for cryptocurrency and not dollars.
The 1:1 dollar to tether ratio is currently untrue. Issuance of new USDT has become a centralised emission of a supposedly "dollar-backed" virtual currency, by a financial entity with banking restrictions.


## Bitfinex's trade engine crashed

Coupled with it's own currency, Bitfinex has become a liquidity provider, thanks to its ability to issue Tether dollars and **loans**. Today, traders have access to leveraged positions on Tether and most altcoin exchanges accept it as a unit of account.  

A flash crash occurred during the emission of 100 million USDT, on multiple markets including Bitcoin, Ether and NEO pairs, to name a few.  
It started a series of liquidations among margin traders on Bitfinex.

{{< img src="news/bitfinex-tether-fraud-mtgox2.png" class="img-fluid my-4" alt="NEO went from $40 to $4" >}} 

The price of NEO went from $40 to $4 in a matter of hours.  
A quick glance at <a href=https://www.reddit.com/r/bitfinex/ target=_true>r/Bitfinex</a> will tell you that users aren't happy about it, to say the least.

{{< img src="news/bitfinex-tether-fraud-mtgox6.png" class="img-fluid my-4" alt="Reddit thread filled up with complaints" >}}  


## Tether's volume is non-sensical

Tether has been trading at a volume far superior to its market capitalisation.
Tether's core feature is to provide "fiat liquidity" to altcoin exchanges, including Poloniex and Bittrex. Mixed with high leveraged positioned, trading bots, and unlimited tokens, volume levels can reach new highs.


{{< img src="news/bitfinex-tether-fraud-mtgox3.png" class="img-fluid my-4" alt="Volume is twice as big as market cap" >}}  

On November 30th, Tether's 24-hour volume went up to $1.7 billion, double its market capitalisation.


## How will it stop?

There are allegations, if not evidence, of Bitcoin price manipulation from the Bitfinex Tether clan. As such, <a href=www.twitter.com/bitfinexed target=_blank>Bitfinex'ed</a> has suggested that :

* Chatbots govern the USD / USDT on Kraken 
* Issuance of Tether and Bitcoin price correlate

{{< youtube 7LlCKQjwmFM >}}

{{< img src="news/bitfinex-tether-fraud-mtgox5.png" class="img-fluid my-4" alt="correlation between new Tether and bitcoin price jump" >}} 

With increased awareness within the cryptocurrency community and mainstream media, Tether will not be able to continue in an unregulated environment for long. 

As long as their operations stay hidden from the regulator, and the market prices remain at par, Tether could virtually keep on printing new tokens unchallenged.

Decrease in USDT price should trigger a crash.
