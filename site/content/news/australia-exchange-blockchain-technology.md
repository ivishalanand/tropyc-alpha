Australian Securities Exchange (ASX) plans to become the first financial marketplace built on distributed ledger technology (DLT), according to an official <a href=http://www.asx.com.au/documents/asx-news/ASX-Selects-DLT-to-Replace-CHESS-Media-Release-7December2017.pdf?ecid=O~SO~~~~chess-release~Twitter~~201712~~ target=_blank>press release</a>.

Implemented by US-based blockchain start-up Digital Asset, the infrastructure is set to replace CHESS (Clearing House Electronic Subregister System), the operating system that has been running the show for over 25 years.
The deployment has been approved after a two-year test and extensive review from regulators and key personnel.

 >“We’ve given over 80 DLT system demonstrations
to more than 500 attendees, and conducted over 60 CHESS replacement workshops for more than 100
organisations from the global financial services industry." Peter Hion, ASX Deputy CEO.

ASX plans to transition to DLT by the end of March 2018, but has not declared if the replacement of CHESS would be complete or partial.

The new system will facilitate a secure private network operated and controlled by ASX, where participants will have to comply with "ongoing and enforceable obligations" to access the network.

According to the press release, customers will have increased flexibility concerning post-trade services and have the opportunity to use global ISO 20022 messaging services.

Managing Director Dominic Stevens stated that the implementation of DLT  "will put Australia at the forefront of innovation in financial markets”.
