LendEDU polled 672 Bitcoin investors to understand the relationship between personal finance and cryptocurrency speculation.

Results showcase that many of these new generation investors purchase digital assets via debt instruments. Leveraging personal finance for investment can become extremely risky, especially in the cryptocurrency market where price volatility has reached levels unheard of on Wall Street.

## Results

When asked what best described their method of payment to purchase cryptocurrencies, respondents stated the following:

{{< img src="news/survey-investor-payment-method1.png" class="img-fluid my-3" alt="Bitfinex's landing page" >}}

* 18.6% by ACH bank transfer
* 13.4% by bank wire
* 33.6% by debit card
* 18.2% by credit card
* 16.2% other

Amongst those who purchase with credit cards (18.1%), the survey asked respondents whether they paid off their outstanding balance:

* 77.87% said they paid off the balance
* 22.13% said they did not pay it off yet

Amongst those who purchase with credit cards but did not clear their balance (~4% of total), the survey asked whether they were comfortable paying interests as a result of owning cryptocurrencies:

* 70.37% said it was worth the expense
* 29.63% said they were worried about the expense

Respondents from the same group answered whether they planned to pay off their interest expenses from the returns of Bitcoin investment:

* 88.89% said yes
* 11.11% said no

Finally, credit card buyers were asked whether they were planning to purchase additional Bitcoin via the same method of payment:

* 76.23% said yes
* 23.77% said no

## Observation

First, the sample size is relatively small, as low as 27 for the last two questions, meaning interpretation is subject to little statistical significance when reported to the entire Bitcoin "hodler" population.

Interestingly, only a minority of respondents, 18.6% of the sample, utilise the most cost-efficient and financial savvy method of payment: ACH bank transfers (since there are no fees).  

As such, more than 80% of the sample purchase cryptocurrencies via an expensive method of payment. Debit card (33.63%) and credit card (18.15%) fees can go up to 8% depending on the exchange, with Coinbase - the leading exchange - charging approximately 4% per transaction.

For those who use credit cards, 30% are worried about incurring interest expense and around 90% are thinking of paying off the expense from cryptocurrency investment earnings.

In this case, "credit card" investors are not protected from a market correction or crash. Although the market has been outperforming any other financial opportunity, investors are still at the mercy of massive price swings that can leave substantial debt, worsened by expensive interests.

Finally, as credit card investors may comprehend the underlying risks of leveraged positions, a majority are still looking to double down their cryptocurrency investment through the same payment channel - that's 13.8% of the sample size.

Considering the credit card average annual percentage rate (APR) is 15%, credit card investors entering a position at the wrong time should face serious debt in the event of a market correction - something extremely likely after the massive bull run of 2017 end.
