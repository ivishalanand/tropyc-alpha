Bitcoin.com released earlier today a new version of their online wallet application available on Apple's application store.

The marketing material stipulates it "supports both SegWit Bitcoin (BTC) and Bitcoin Cash (BCH)".

However, the application appears to be somewhat misleading for users, as the description includes that "Bitcoin Cash (BCH) wallets are created by default" and provides "Bitcoin Cash (BCH) multi-sig wallets".

By doing so, Bitcoin.com may lure users to select the Bitcoin Cash chain thinking it is the legacy chain.

The website, owned by Roger Ver, has often released controversial material over the scaling debate.
After the Bitcoin Cash hard fork and the controversial implementation of  SegWit2x, Bitcoin.com stayed blurry over which chain would be considered "BTC". 

Roger Ver has often utilised his website as a [propaganda tool](https://www.bitcoin.com/info/bitcoin-cash-is-bitcoin) to promote an increase in Bitcoin's block size.
