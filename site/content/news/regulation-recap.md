Country-specific central banks all have their own way of handling the blockchain and cryptocurrency revolution, whether they are all-embracing or on the defensive side.  
As the last week has been full of announcements from financial regulators, here's a recap of the situation:

## Zimbabwe says Bitcoin is not legal

Shortly after the resignation of 92-year-old president Robert Mugabe, Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe (RBZ) director Norman Maturaka told <a href="http://www.chronicle.co.zw/bitcoin-is-not-legal-rbz" target="_blank">The Chronicle</a> that Bitcoin was never deemed legal in the country.

>"In terms of Bitcoin, as far as we are concerned, it is not actually legal. In Southern Africa, what we have done as regulators, we have said that we will allow this in our markets".

The RBZ approach has been around prevention and advising the people to undertake cautionary steps before entering the cryptocurrency market.  
The Bitcoin mania was introduced in mid-July 2015 by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MMM_(Ponzi_scheme_company)" target="_blank">MMM Ponzi scheme</a>, where over 60,000 investors lost their capital.

## Malaysia focused on criminal activities

According to <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-malaysia-cenbank-cryptocurrency/malaysia-says-working-on-regulatory-framework-for-crypto-currencies-idUSKBN1DM0DQ" target="_blank">Reuters</a>, the Governor of the Bank Negara Malaysia (BNM) announced exchanges would have to comply with the financial regulator as "reporting institutions" under the "Anti-Money Laundering, Anti-Terrorism Financing and Proceeds of Unlawful Activities Act".

Commenting on a counter-terrorism panel, Muhammad further stated that regulating cryptocurrencies would "prevent the abuse of the system for criminal and unlawful activities and ensure the stability and integrity of the financial system".

## Bermuda's new task force

The Government of Bermuda introduced a Blockchain Task Force to develop a regulatory framework for tokenised digital assets, via an <a href="https://www.gov.bm/articles/blockchain-working-group-members-announced" target="_blank">official press release</a>. It aims to create a positive legal and business environment for ICOs, token securities and cryptocurrencies in Bermuda.  

The north Atlantic British territory has been "elected" world's worse corporate tax haven <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/dec/12/bermuda-is-worlds-worst-corporate-tax-haven-says-oxfam" target="_blank">in 2016 by non-profit Oxfam</a>.

## Philippines looks at exchanges and ICOs

Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) commissioner Emilio Aquino told during an event that Initial Coin Offerings and cryptocurrencies are to be considered "securities", <a href ="http://www.manilatimes.net/regulators-eye-wider-virtual-currency-use/364344" target="_blank">as reported by Manila Times</a>.

The objective is to align with global legislation as depicted in the US, Hong Kong or Thailand to consider digital assets securities.

Furthermore, Aquino revealed a collaboration between the regulator and the central bank regarding licensing of exchanges. In fact, a couple of domestic cryptocurrency exchanges have already registered with the government, but are still restricted

## For the Swiss, Bitcoin is more investment than currency

Swiss National Bank Chairman Thomas Jordan stated local central bank is working on government-issued cryptocurrencies.

He further stated that he sees Bitcoin (and cryptocurrencies) "more as an investment than a form of currency", <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-swiss-snb/snbs-jordan-sees-crypto-currencies-as-more-of-investment-than-currency-idUSKBN1DN1ZM" target="_blank"> a Reuters report says</a>.

While Switzerland is still investigating about a possible implementation of cryptocurrencies in their monetary policy, Jordan admitted that they "can potentially strongly affect the financial system".

## Singapore expands scope of Payment Bill to cryptocurrencies

As blockchain technology has drastically reduced transaction fees, the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) is looking to regulate cryptocurrencies under a legal policy for payment services.

<a href="http://www.mas.gov.sg/News-and-Publications/Media-Releases/2017/MAS-Launches-Second-Consultation-on-New-Regulatory-Framework-for-Payments.aspx" target="_blank">The second publication of the Payment Service Bill</a> aims to "expand the scope of regulated payment activities to include virtual currency services and other innovations". 

The bill will help streamline the payment industry by simplifying the regulatory environment. It states that "payment firms will only need to hold one licence under a single regulatory framework to conduct any or all of the specified payment activities".

## South Korea denies any plan to regulate Bitcoin

According to <a href="http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/biz/2017/11/488_239795.html" target="_blank">the Korean Times</a> Financial Supervisory Service (FSS) Governor Choe Heung-sik said that the Korean regulator has no plans to supervise transactions of digital tokens and cryptocurrencies, as they are legitimate currencies.

Choe stated that these new types of assets do not work as a payment instrument and are subject to considerable speculation.

>"It is the same with the fact that we don't regulate or supervise casinos. Though there could be concerns on excessive gambling, that does not provide grounds for the FSS to control casino practices."
