## 1. Caveat emptor

This business principle means that buyers/investors should do their own research before purchasing an asset.
With ICOs, it's **their way or the highway**: there are no rounds of negotiation.

Unlike with Angel Investment and Venture Capital (AA/VC), investors taking part in an ICO/TGE are not able to change the terms of the sale nor to interact with the founding team: it is a fixed and unnegotiable sale.

## 2. Understanding the token distribution is primordial

Before buying any tokens, one needs to understand its fundamentals and distribution carefully â€“ just like when you purchase a stock or any other financial instrument.

The price of a single token does not give any information on its distribution.
Furthermore, the valuation of the _crowdsale_ is different from the valuation of the _total supply_.

Investors should understand:

* Total distribution of units (investors, founders, advisors, future emission...)
* Valuation of the total supply of units
* Emission rate of tokens and inflation rate

Assessing the economy of an ICO/TGE starts with answering the following questions:

* Who will have tokens, and how much of them?
* What is the valuation of the entire token supply?
* How many tokens/coins will exist in the future?

## 3. No hard capitalisation is dangerous

An ICO/TGE/tokensale without a maximum valuation is a bit like purchasing an object that has no fixed price tag.
As such, investors cannot forecast the value of the total token supply with an uncapped hard capitalisation.

Furthermore, investors with large cryptocurrency positions can undertake fraudulent ICOs by organising and investing in their project as follows:

1. Organise a fake ICO
2. Market the product
3. Inject funds in the project
4. ICO cap increases fraudulently
5. ICO awareness may increase

Here, a malicious agent could merely move funds from a personal wallet to an ICO wallet.

## 4. Allocation of the funds should be planned and transparent

Most of the projects keep a substantial amount of tokens/coin for early investors, advisors and the founding team.

Nothing different from common start-up equity, as founders typically keep a large chunk of shares after raising a round of funding.

However, keep in mind that successful ICOs raise considerable amounts of cryptocurrencies. Just like any fundraising round, founding team should explain how they will spend the capital.
Otherwise, it is a clear sign of a lack of business planning, and it often comes with significant risks of mismanagement.

## 5. Pre-ICO and bonus can get messy

Investors should stay aware of pre-sale events and bonuses.
As such, the difference in valuation between the pre-sale and the sale should be justified.

For instance, a tenfold increase between two sales in three months may appear far-fetched.
Additionally, granting more than 20% bonus for early investments by two weeks may also seem unjustified.

## 6. Smaller ticket size means more PR

One of the core value proposition of decentralised crowdfunding is the ability for investors to invest in early-stage ventures without considerable funds.
In fact, traditionally, start-up investors are required to pour in at least $100,000 in a start-up.
Today, anyone can invest as low as $100 via cryptocurrency.

Start-ups raising funds via an ICO / TGE have therefore a larger pool of investors compared with AA / VC.
It introduces additional stakeholder engagement deliverables:

* **Acquisition**: resource draining marketing campaign via digital media to attract potential investors.
* **Support**: Once investors are hooked, teams need to set-up online support on instant messaging channels for any queries.
* **Updates**: During and after the event, teams need to stay in touch with investors and communicate each milestone.

We think that a project that fails to deliver the above should not be worthy of funds.

## 7. Investor verification is the new standard

Founding teams that decide not to reveal their identity have less chance to convince cryptocurrency enthusiasts to invest.

With the emergence of strict regulations in the ICO realm, serious projects will have to track their investors in the primary market. This practise will most probably become prevalent in the industry.

If sharing your identity during a sale is problematic, you can remain private when purchasing digital assets on the secondary market.


## 8. ICOs can get hacked or facilitate fraudulent activities

Hackers have been a significant threat in the cryptocurrency market. Exchanges, wallets, ICOs, all are vulnerable to digital attacks.

Investors cannot accurately assess the risk of both hack and fraud. However, to reassure investors, ICOs should hire third-party audit to evaluate the quality of the blockchain and its legal status for current and future regulations.
