Bitcoin futures launched on Chicago Mercantile Exchange's (CME) financial derivative marketplace on Sunday evening, a week after their introduction on smaller competitor Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE).

## Why futures contract?

Futures contracts allow institutional capital and mainstream finance to gain exposure to cryptocurrency markets.
It is an agreement to buy or sell an asset or commodity at a price defined today but delivered and paid in the future.

They are multiple advantages to futures contracts including:

* Ability to own Bitcoin without baring the cybersecurity risk of holding them.
* Absence of interaction with centralised crypto-exchanges that can crash or get hacked.
* Opportunity to trade Bitcoin on regulated marketplaces which reduces the risk of government intervention in the long run.
* Increase market penetration of cryptocurrency to a broader audience, including investors looking to diversify their portfolio or markets where Bitcoin is illegal.
* Increase liquidity which may reduce volatility and arbitrage opportunity.


## Where to purchase a future contract?

Bitcoin futures have been available for a while now, on unregulated exchanges such as BitMEX or OKCoin.

Regarding regulated exchanges, CBOE and CME's contracts slightly differ, so here is a comparative analysis:

### Chicago Board Options Exchange

1. Contract size: 1 Bitcoin
2. Collateral required: 44%
3. Settlement price: 4 PM (EST) on Gemini
4. Settlement date: Each of the next three months
5. Settlement day:  Two days before the third Friday of settlement month
6. Volatility break: 10% and 20% price variations trigger a 2-minute break

### Chicago Mercantile Exchange

1. Contract size: 5 Bitcoin
2. Collateral required: 35%
3. Settlement price: CME Bitcoin rate (Weighted average of prices from Bitstamp, GDAX, itBit and Kraken)
4. Settlement date: March, June, September, December
5. Settlement day:  Last Friday of settlement month
6. Volatility break: 7%, 13% and 20% price variations trigger a 2-minute break (above 20%, it shuts down for the day)

## What happens at the end of a future contract?

Regulated exchanges settle futures in cash and not in Bitcoin. 
 
Purchasing a CBOE futures contract for, let's say, $20,000, would require $8,800 in an account, before being able to open any position.  
After three months, if the price drops to $10,000 per unit: the seller does not have to send a Bitcoin. Instead, he settles in cash the price difference, so that the buyer can purchase one.

## Futures, now what?

During this week's first CME session, investors traded over $80 million worth of Bitcoin between each other.
It represents over 847 January expired contracts, worth 5 Bitcoins each, that were successfully auctioned on world's largest derivative exchanges.

Bitcoin futures contracts are the first cryptocurrency derivatives introduced to mainstream finance and under the regulator's scrutiny. 
The increased media attention towards Bitcoin has also revealed other large market capitalisation digital assets to the world of institutionalised finance. 

With Bloomberg's recent introduction of Ether, Ripple and Litecoin to its terminals, and the Winklevoss brothers persistent attempt to launch a Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Fund (COIN), cryptocurrencies have just begun their journey in a regulated and mainstream environment.
