## Impressive 48h recovery

After a significant downturn over the weekend, the cryptocurrency market is continuing its bull run after the introduction of Bitcoin futures.

On the eve of CBOE Bitcoin futures launch, the cryptocurrency market capitalisation reduced from $440 billion to $360 billion. Today, markets recorded an impressive recovery with a valuation of $444 billion at the time of writing, after a sharp price correction.

## Bitcoin dominance unaffected

Bitcoin drove total cryptocurrency market capitalisation when its price reduces from $18,000 on Friday to below $14,000 on Sunday. Over the weekend, Bitcoin dominance stagnated around the 62% mark.

The Bitcoin dominance index represents the share of Bitcoin circulating supply's market capitalisation out of the total cryptocurrency valuation. Bitcoin "governs" total cryptocurrency market capitalisation.

## Newcomers aren't into alternative coins

As Bitcoin dominance index remains stable when total cryptocurrency valuation varies, it indicates that Bitcoin is the primary focus of market players in the current scenario.

The sudden exposure of cryptocurrency to a broader audience via mainstream media may just lead to an organic publicity towards smaller capitalisation cryptocurrencies.  
As such, the market can expect growing demand into "secondary" cryptocurrencies as newcomers will understand that the realm of cryptocurrency is way larger than just Bitcoin.

First signs of such patterns is the impressive growth of Litecoin, also known as "digital silver". The asset grew from $100 on Friday to $180 on Monday morning. That's a 80% increase over the weekend.
