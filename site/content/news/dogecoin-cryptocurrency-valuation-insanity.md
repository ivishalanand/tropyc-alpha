Started as a joke in 2013, Dogecoin is a meme-inspired cryptocurrency that witnessed tremendous growth last month. Other than its logo inspired from the Shiba Inu - a Japanese dog breed - cryptocurrency analysts struggle to find any unique selling points that may explain its booming valuation. 

## First dog to the moon?

Dogecoin market capitalisation peaked at a $2 billion on the 7th of January, up from Christmas' $1 billion.

Has there been any significant development or improvement in the Dogecoin fundamentals to justify a 100% increase in two weeks?

No.

Even Dogecoin founder Jackson Palmer stated he was concerned that "a currency with a dog on it, which hasn't released a software update in over two years has a $1 billion + market cap".

The development team finally pushed some code on the <a href=https://github.com/dogecoin/dogecoin target=_link>cryptocurrency's repository</a>, after 3 years without any software update.  
Note that the latest commit accounts to only **two lines of code** - nothing game-changing.

## Doge's first byte

Jackson Palmer, currently a tech lead at Adobe, admitted to Vice's Motherboard that he created Dogecoin "without much real thought". 

> "One night after work, I sat down with a beer, I had too much time on my hands, and I bought Dogecoin.com. Then I Photoshopped the logo onto the coin and put it up there." Jackson Palmer, co-founder of Dogecoin

The Shiba "doge" quickly triggered incredible growth amongst the community and even attracted people from outside the cryptocurrency realm. <a href=http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/doge target=_blank>A complete history of the famous Japanese dog</a> reveals how  extraordinary the craze for the dog has become. The Doge meme not only gathers a canine fanatics but manages to have a political as well as an economic impact globally. 

The key to Dogecoin success is not about the block size limit, confirmation speed, blockchain consensus or the fact that it is merely a Litecoin clone. Dogecoin has become one of the most valuable cryptocurrency in the world because of its mascot - a fluffy dog, **nothing else**.

## A joke worth $2 billion

There's little space for debate, Shiba Inu has become **the most valuable meme in history**. And it reveals a more disturbing truth: the cryptocurrency market is filled with irrational investors pouring money into coins and tokens that do not have the fundamentals to back such exorbitant valuations. 

Unfortunately, Dogecoin is not the only cryptocurrency that witnessed tremendous growth without any significant improvements (we're looking at you, <a href=https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/tron/ target=_blank>Tron</a>, <a href=https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/verge/ target=_blank>Verge</a> and <a href=https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/cardano/ target=_blank>Cardano</a>). Instead, the unprecedented performance of the market is driven by network effects, a combination of "hodling", aggressive promotion and injection of fresh capital - which naturally drive prices up. 

If Dogecoin is successful because of its mascot, how many cryptocurrencies are booming thanks to a well designed logo?

Today, investors are betting on potential future utility rather than current utility. In this mindset, without mainstream adoption, cryptocurrencies would not last long against fiat and other coins with unique value propositions.

While Dogecoin has not revolutionised decentralised payments, it gathers a genuine community passionate about **Japanese fluffy dogs**, which is awesome to say the least - as depicted in this incredible marketing material.
