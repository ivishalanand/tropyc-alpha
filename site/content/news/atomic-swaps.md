Until the cryptocurrency world facilitates decentralised exchanges, users will have to face a counter-intuitive truth: to trust third parties when swapping digital currencies.  
Exchanges are, at the end of the day, centralised and have been lacking innovation in the crypto space.   

As everything is becoming permissionless and trustless, exchanges are still running behind as they are run by centralised entities.   

In fact, an investor who stores his tokens on an exchange does not own them per se, but holds an I Owe U (IOU) from the exchange, in other words, a promise that an intermediary will issue the token when requested.  
(Learn more about IOU and wallet [here](crypto-101/wallets/intro/))  

Exchanges have arguably been considered the point of weakness in our industry because of hacks, controversies over market manipulation or intentional lags and delays.  

The crypto world will never be truly decentralised until we find a way to facilitate trustless token exchanges.  

Introduced in 2013 by Tier Nolan, _atomic cross-chain trading_, aka _atomic swaps_ might just be the solution. Thanks to the Lightning network, an off-chain scaling solution for blockchain, users can swap digital currencies instantly and securely.  

It is considered “atomic” because the trade either happens or not, without the space for any discrepancies. 

With this technology breakthrough, users do not need to trust any centralised entity or a peer to swap currencies.  

Let’s illustrate this with a simple example:

1.	Alice has 1 BTC and wants 20 LTC.
2.	Bob has 20 LTC and wants 1 BTC.
3.	Alice and Bob do not know each other and are afraid of exchange hacks.

Rather than logging on [Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/join/59abb5ab6c9e6700d36656d6) or [Shapeshift](https://shapeshift.io), Alice and Bob should set up an atomic cross-chain swap to guarantee the transaction occurs on the two networks.

1.  Alice and Bob issue a transaction on the Bitcoin and Litecoin blockchain.
2.  Alice is able to claim the 20 LTC if she reveals a number that only she has access to.
3.  Similarly, Bob is able to claim his BTC if he reveals the same number.
4.  When one of them claims their tokens, the other one can do the same.

(note : This is a simplified explanation of atomic swaps: the technology uses hash time-locked contracts, which are outside the scope of this article)  

Previously, atomic swaps were considered to work on blockchains that have implemented the Lightning Network.  

However, Charlie Lee, inventor of Litecoin and crypto guru, recently performed a swap between Litecoin / Decred and between Litecoin / Bitcoin without the need of the Lightning Network.

It is worth noting that atomic swaps are currently at a development stage without any integration on a leading exchange, therefore it cannot cater mainstream cryptocurrency enthusiasts yet.  

However, there are repositories available [here](https://medium.com/decred/on-chain-atomic-swaps-bdb29fa2c92c) to conduct atomic swaps between Bitcoin, Litecoin and Decred.  

Atomic swaps only execute peer-to-peer trades and do not facilitate order book management and pricing. You will have to find a peer and negotiate with him before starting an atomic swap.  

In fact, a fully-fledged decentralised trading solution would have to incorporate atomic swaps with an order book management and pleasant user experience before we can expect large scale trustless and peer-to-peer exchanges.  

This is a major breakthrough for the cryptocurrency world, as the publishing of open-source repositories enables users to issue transparent and private transactions and disintermediate the entire process.  

Promising time to be a cryptocurrency enthusiast !
