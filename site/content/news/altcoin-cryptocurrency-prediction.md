We have witnessed tremendous growth in the cryptocurrency market this year, with Bitcoin, Ethereum and recently Litecoin leading the way.
The "Big Three" valuation increased by 2,100% from $16.4 to $360 billion in less than twelve months.

In the same period, the proportion of BTC, ETH, LTC out of the total cryptocurrency market capitalisation, decreased from 92% to 71% indicating a growing demand for smaller capitalisation cryptocurrencies.
Although there's been a frenzy in trading Bitcoin and Litecoin last month, it is a clear signal that altcoins are gaining popularity amongst the crypto investment community.

## Privacy-focused

The first "utility" of the space is to dissociate one's financial behaviour with one's identity.  
Perfect for private transactions, cryptocurrency offers tangible value when exchanging from a peer to another. 
Privacy-focused coins may become the next sub-market to go under mainstream spotlight, including Monero, ZCash or Particl.

## Market-specific

The crypto-economy is still under development with its infrastructure missing a few pillars before achieving efficient operations. How CryptoKitties clogged the Ethereum network showcases how the decentralised economy has not reached scalable systems yet.

Products in distributed computation (Golem), decentralised exchange (0x), internet of things (Iota) and file storage (Filecoin, Storj) should gain traction if they keep their community up to date and meet their targets.

## Region-specific

Cryptocurrency has become ubiquitious and cosmopolitan with every local market representing a decent share of transaction volume. Asia, USA, Europe and Russia might create their own "captain of the industry".
Smart contract development platform NEO from China, open payment application OmiseGO from Thailand or blockchain platform Waves from Russia are examples of projects leveraging the "act local" mindset.

## ICOs

2017 has been a pivotal year for Initial Coin Offerings with some project valuations reaching as high as three hundred million dollars. Ease of access to token sale documentation and data will trigger substantial growth for seed funding via cryptocurrency.
