## Crazy valuations are over

This summer, three projects, Tezos, Bancor and Filecoin have raised $600 million combined in a matter of days - and as of today:

* Tezos is in the middle of a financial and legal crisis.
* Bancor is witnessing a two-fold decrease in valuation.
* Filecoin is still illiquid for investors, even after six months.

Six months down the line, only a handful of projects have raised more than $100 million.  
With regulation expected to step up in the coming months, projects at a pre-product market fit stage might not be able to reach the same valuations than the ones of this summer.

## More ICOs but dropping success rate

Improved accessibility to the technology has galvanised the market and drastically increased the supply of ICOs.

According to tokendata.io, the number of ICOs have jumped from less than 20 to 90 per month, between May and October of this year. Additionally, the success rate, defined by reaching the hard capitalisation, has plummeted from 50% to less than 20%. 

The trend of overvaluation and ICO hype has apparently cooled off.  
Six months ago, the market was undersupplied and over-demanded, today, the market appears to be oversupplied and under-demanded.

The data should be interpreted with caution, as a substantial amount of ICOs has not been included.

## New tech means new rules

Thanks to this new-gen financial instrument, founders can quickly raise funds via cryptocurrencies: an alternative to venture capital.

However, the process comes with new challenges for projects:

* ICOs are resource draining and need hefty investments for marketing, legal and technology purposes.
* Mitigation of cybersecurity risks requires expertise in smart contract development and third-party audits.
* Rather than meeting dozens of Venture Capitalists, projects have to reach to hundreds of thousands of prospective investors, in order to build a pool of investors of 5,000 or more.
* Teams need to set-up effective and 24/7 investor relations on instant-messaging applications such as Slack or Telegram, to facilitate customised support.
* As the market is currently unregulated, ICOs may be subject to security law shortly. Failure to provide evidence of compliance will impact valuation negatively.

## ICOs are competing with previous ones

ICOs turn traditionally illiquid investments into liquid ones, by the issuance of digital assets to investors. Therefore, projects going through an ICO round have two types of competition:

* Projects seeking investment during the same period.
* Projects who have already closed an ICO round and have liquid assets listed on exchanges.

After an ICO round, digital assets issued are liquid, as they can be transferred easily from peer-to-peer.  
Rather than purchasing a token on the primary market (ICO) that holds substantial risk (defective smart contract, fraud), investors can purchase more "mature" tokens on the secondary market (exchange).

From an investor's perspective, there are lower risks of entering a position in a token that is already listed on exchanges, with a transparent and market-driven valuation.

As such, investing in ICOs remains relatively risky, primarily because of the _caveat emptor_ principle: "the ICO way or the highway", aka the golden rule of ICO investment.  
Projects set their valuation themselves, without any round of negotiation with investors.

Before purchasing tokens via an ICO, prospective investors need to understand the token distribution, the total token supply valuation, the product stage of development, the project roadmap and the team's capability amongst other factors.
