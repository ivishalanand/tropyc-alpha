## Tezos: a $232 million shit show

Last month, a lawsuit was filed in a California court against Tezos, world's largest ICO after they raised over $232 million in cryptocurrencies.  
Founders have reportedly violated US Security Law by promising to issue an unregulated token to investors. 

In fact, two different legal entities launched the Tezos fundraiser:  A Delaware-based corporation Dynamic Ledger Solutions IncGevors, directed by  Kathleen and Arthur Breitmanns and a Swiss-based non-profit, Tezos Foundation, handled my Johann Gevors.

Till date, Tezos has failed to **distribute any digital assets to investors** due to in-house disaccords.   
The project showed early signs of mismanagement after reports of overpaid wages.  

It all started when the Breitmanns accused Grevors in a press release of an "attempt at self-dealing, misrepresenting to the council the value of a bonus he attempted to grant himself."
 
Surprisingly, founders had the idea to launch Tezos because of Bitcoin's poor governance.  
Oh, the irony.

## Bancor or how to lose half your investment in 4 months

In June, Tel-Aviv start-up Bancor raised more than $150 million in a few hours. The product: a decentralised liquidity network to facilitate fast and easy exchanges between cryptocurrencies.  
Holders of the Bancor Smart Token would be able to swap currencies on a market-making platform.  

In just four months, the price of a Bancor token plunged by 50-60%, diluting early investors cryptocurrencies severely.

It turns out the protocol has often been referred by the tech community as "needlessly complicated" and often misunderstood by the general cryptocurrency audience.  

For instance, Cornell professor Emin Gun Surer  (who turns out to be an advisor for Tezos) stated that Bancor has "one idea, that by itself I donâ€™t think is sufficient".  
He further said that Bancor's core technology is less efficient than manual market making. 
Even Blockchain Capital co-founder Brock Pierce, who's a Bancor investor, reported that "Not everyone understands it".

Still, the project value proposition is already in high demand according to Bancor, as 30-odd projects are planning to use the technology.

Bancor is facing issued listing its tokens on exchanges which ironically reduces the liquidity of the token, built to ... increase liquidity.

## ICOs will change the world

The industry will have to learn from its previous mistakes, namely overvaluation, lack of regulation and raising funds at a very early stage of product development.  

Long gone are the golden days when investors could invest in ICOs (with attractive bonuses) and expect a 5 to 10 fold return on investment, only in a matter of weeks.

At this point, there was a scarcity of projects raising funds via cryptocurrencies.   
Today, the market is booming regarding amounts of projects, but collapsing concerning investor's expected returns on investment.  
We may expect a substantial amount of token to reach zero market capitalisation.

But the technology has not changed a bit: anyone can issue digital assets and raise funds from anyone, without the need of a third party in the process. 

More than issuing a security, ICOs and TGEs can grant rights to holders: for instance, governance in decision-making or access to a marketplace.  
Today, the limits seem unimaginable in today's current scenario, acceptance rate, infrastructure and market penetration of cryptocurrencies.  
At the least, ICOs and TGEs give a valuable alternative for projects to raise funds.

Yes, there have been multiple failures in the ICO market, but such ground-breaking technology inevitably paves the way for future innovation and exciting disruption.
