Even if you comprehend the ever-changing fundamentals of cryptocurrencies, investing in this space is still _extremely_ risky.

Be sure only to invest what you can afford to lose, and stay focused on tokens that have (or will have) utility to their end users.

Before we start, let's go through a gentle reminder of the risks you are taking when investing in crypto and how to mitigate them.
Second, we'll showcase strategies that can help you design a well-performing portfolio.

## Risk

### Hackers can steal your funds

**Problem**

In crypto, you are your own bank and hold the responsibility to store your wealth in a safe place.

You have the choice either to share your private keys to third parties (online wallet), to control and store them in an online environment (hot wallet) or an offline device (cold wallet).

Access to your private keys are vulnerable to digital and physical attacks: if a theft occurs, there is no way to get them back
Cybersecurity is a field that is constantly evolving, and you might just never achieve full security.

**Solution**

However, you can disincentivise hackers to attack you with wallet _compartmentalisation_.

Wallet compartmentalisation means creating transaction management systems that are never correlated to each other regarding online web exposure.

In other words, if you have three wallet systems, a hacker would take time to spread his attack from one system to another.

One wallet system would comprise of, for instance, one cold, two hot, and two online wallets (exchange).  
If you compartmentalise two wallet systems, this would mean that none of the two wallets systems can be traced back to the other one (hardware, software, password, transactions).

If a hacker compromises one system, it should be _difficult_ for him to break another one.

Protecting your cryptocurrencies and assets starts with:

* Store most of your wealth on cold wallets.
* Add an extra layer of protection for hot and online wallets with 2-factor authentification (why not try FIDO U2F standard).
* Generate strong and unique passwords to lock your private keys.
* Protect your internet behaviour with a VPN.

This might sound Jason Bourne-esque, but better be safe than sorry!

If you want to learn about wallets and storing your crypto securely, kindly refer to the second part of our crypto 101 series [here](/crypto-101/wallets/intro/).

### Exchanges are unsafe

**Problem**

We still have to rely on third-party agents when entering the altcoin market as there are currently no decentralised exchanges available.
Indeed, only a select few exchanges provide an extensive list of tokens, mostly priced in Bitcoin and Ether.

You will have to send Bitcoins to an intermediate and lose ownership of your private keys to purchase specific tokens.

Furthermore, it can get cumbersome to track your portfolio in different exchanges, as there are only three particular types of exchanges:

* **Fiat to crypto:** Accepts fiat as a deposit and is often restricted to a selected few cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, Ether and Litecoin.  
_Extensive Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) compliance_

* **Crypto to Crypto:** Lists any tokens, but does not accept fiat deposits.  
_Poor or no KYC/AML_

* **P2P facilitation:** Community platform that matches buyers and sellers. Acts like an over the counter. Available in Bitcoin and Ethereum.  
_Poor or no KYC/AML_

**Solution**

* Avoid storing cryptocurrencies and assets on more than two different types of exchanges.

* Keep most of your tokens on hot and cold wallets and trade with approximately 20% of your portfolio.
If something averse happens to the exchange, you'll still have some crypto available.

* Protect yourself against attackers and lock your account with 2-factor authentification.

* Stay alert to the exchange threat and understand that hackers have targeted them and stolen millions of dollars in the past. It can happen again.

### Volatility in price can make me lose everything

**Problem**

The notion value in crypto has become very controversial and still subject to many debates.
Public opinion is split between those who think crypto is going to change the world and and others that think it's just a scam.

Thing is, mainstream media shares and writes from both points of view:

**Negative**

* JP Morgan's CEO Jamie Dimon thinks Bitcoin is "a fraud" and "eventually it will be closed".
* Many media outlets such as NY Times, Forbes and Fortune have stated that the cryptocurrencies are in a bubble.

**Positive**

* Microsoft founder Bill Gates thinks that “Bitcoin is a technological tour de force”.
* Former US Vice President Al Gore states that "an algorithm replaces the function of the government …[that] is actually pretty cool."
* IMF President Christine Lagarde stated that "digital currencies are here to stay."

Truth is, you can lose your money very quickly in crypto, especially when trading on crypto to crypto pairs.
It is not uncommon to witness colossal price volatility, up to 60-70% loss in a matter of weeks.

Investing in the wrong assets can dilute your position and tear your portfolio apart.

**Solution**

* Understand that Bitcoin is a threat to central and private banks as it disintermediates the process of payment and offers transparent emission rates.

* Most of "old school" bankers and regulators will spread FUD (Fear, Uncertainty, Doubt) about the future of crypto.

* Keep some established cryptocurrencies (Bitcoin, Litecoin, Ethereum) stored in cold wallets with a long-term return on investment timeline in mind.

* No need to become a professional trader in a day, buy your tokens, store them in a safe place, sit back and relax.

### There are so many tokens out there, most are going to die

**Problem**

CoinMarketCap has listed more than a thousand tokens in their database.  
Coupled with the increasing amount of platforms that facilitate the creation of tokens and initial coin offerings for less tech-savvy individuals, we can only assume there will be significant growth in issuance of tokens in the future.

Today, depending on the jurisdiction, ICOs and tokens are either unregulated or banned. Most of them might not exist in the next few years, so it's important to take into account the following factors before investing:

* Anyone can issue a token with minimal programming skills.
* Blockchain tech moves at such a pace that any token can become obsolete.
* Tokens without active developers cannot compete in the market.
* Certain markets already have a high concentration, i.e. privacy-focused tokens or smart contract development platforms.

**Solution**

* Understand the utility of a token before chipping in.  
Never invest in technology you do not understand.  
Even if the technology appears to be advanced, the token's founding team should be able to explain it in _simple_ words.

* Diversify your crypto portfolio based on industry, market capitalisation, geography, token generation, platform, consensus type and more.
Kindly refer to the third part of this chapter "Diversification".

### All of the above makes it high intensity and quite stressful

**Problem**

If you are reading these lines you might be thinking like us: blockchain and digital tokens are the next web revolution and shaping a new kind of decentralised economy.

However, we are still at a very nascent stage, and nothing is guaranteed: cryptocurrencies might not end well - or at least a huge chunk of them might become irrelevant.

With all the price volatility, hacking risks and fraudulent investment opportunities, cryptocurrency investors are vulnerable to lose their capital in a short amount of time.  
Inversely, prices might go through the roof and return considerable profits.

On one hand, cryptocurrencies have introduced new financial instruments to investors, but on the other hand, they also come with substantial risks.

Having the opportunity to transact in the flourishing decentralised economy and keeping control over your capital comes with new externalities that might just make your day a little bit more stressful and a bit more exciting.

**Solution**

It's not because you entered the crypto market that you have to change your investment behaviour and decisions.

Furthermore, if you set up your wallets as explained in our [second tutorial](/crypto-101/wallets), this will reduce probability of a digital attack.

But remember: _scared money makes no money!_

## Set-up

Okay, now that you know the fundamentals and understand the risk of investing in crypto, it's high time to get our hands dirty.

### Savings

First things first: how much money are you supposed to invest in crypto?

As Xapo's CEO Wences Casares said [here](https://forum.bitcoin.com/ama-ask-me-anything/i-am-wences-casares-co-founder-ceo-of-xapo-ask-me-anything-t2025-30.html)
"I always tell them (my family) that the second most stupid thing they could do right now is to own an amount of bitcoins they cannot afford to lose and the most stupid thing they could do would be not to own any."

Well, as a reminder, we are no financial advisors, but we can still give you a ballpark figure.

1. Start with how much you are willing to save from your monthly income. We can't help you with that, but try to save as much as you can!

2. Once you figured out how much you are willing to save, the below matrix may help you understand your level of risk aversion based on how much of your savings you want to allocate to the cryptocurrency market.

### Wallets and storage

Don't rush into cryptocurrency!  
Just like sending an e-mail, working on spreadsheets or navigating the world wide web, you need to learn basic skills before adventuring yourself in the crypto world.

Get the technical literacy to know how to secure your tokens, send them across and build your transaction systems.

Only then, you can start your voyage into the crypto world.

Just like in the real world, you'll have to set up savings and current account in cryptocurrency.

This is how we like to divide our crypto wealth :

<table class="table table-sm table-striped">
  <thead>
    <tr class="text-center font-weight-bold">
      <th class="text-center">Account</th>
      <th class="text-center">% Crypto Capital</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td class="text-center">Savings (cold wallet)</td>
      <td class="text-center">> 60 - 70 %</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td class="text-center">Current (hot wallet)</td>
      <td class="text-center"> 20 - 30 %</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td class="text-center">Cash (online wallet, exchange)</td>
      <td class="text-center">< 10 %</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

### When to buy

**Basics**

Here, we are stating the obvious: if you want to make a profit _buy low_ and _sell high_, not rocket science.  
Avoid entering a position when prices are unstable or going parabolic.

**Automated and periodic investment**

A smart way to invest in cryptocurrency, if charting and trading is not your thing, is to follow a planned periodic investment mechanism.  
Here, you need to invest periodically, the same amount of money.  
For instance, you can invest 50$ in Bitcoin and 50$ in Ethereum every Saturday morning when you wake up!

## Diversification

At tropyc,  we follow an investment strategy based on asset diversification also known as _modern portfolio strategy_. This way, you won't have to put all your eggs in one basket.

You can still focus, for instance, on a handful of industries; but bottom line is that your portolio's level of diversification should illustrate your risk appetite.

At first, keep it simple, invest in established cryptocurrencies that you think will have utility and value in the future (no "shitcoins"!).
Afterwards, you can start diversifying your portfolio and enter riskier investments.

We identified all the variables to take into account when building a customised and diversified portfolio.

### Markets (fiat versus Bitcoin)

There are currently two units of account in the cryptocurrency economy:

**Fiat to crypto**

Only established and high market capitalisation tokens are listed with fiat currencies.
Because exchanges could be somewhat liable for selling securities in a future legal framework, they tend to carefully review any cryptocurrencies before introducing them to USD and EUR markets.

Still, most of the exchanges stay under the radar by only selling Bitcoin, Litecoin and Ethereum.

_Investing in crypto with fiat means betting the price of a unit of crypto will raise_

**BTC / ETH to crypto**

Every single token is priced in Bitcoin, and a majority are also priced in Ether.

A jump in fiat price of Bitcoin or Ether will suddenly increase the market capitalisation of every token that is solely listed on exchanges.

For instance, if Ether goes from $250 to $500 per unit, tokens listed in Ether will see their market capitalisation double in the same amount of time, _ceteris paribus_.  
In this scenario, this would create a downward pressure (sell) on altcoins.

_Investing in an altcoin with Bitcoin or Ether implies that the price of the altcoin will increase faster than the price of Bitcoin or Ether in fiat._

### Industry

Cryptocurrencies are disrupting every industry at scale with the blockchain decentralisation drive.  
An easy way to build your portfolio is to diversify it according to industries.  
For instance, here are a few tokens classified by their industries:

* Smart Contract: Ethereum, NEO
* Gaming: FirstBlood, Gaming credits, Round
* Asset Management: Iconomi, Melon
* Attention economy: Basic Attention Token, Steemit, Synereo
* Prediction: Augur, Gnosis
* Privacy-focused: Monero, ZCash, Verge

Rather than diversifying your portfolio in every single industry, invest in the ones that you feel will have large-scale adoption in a short matter of time.

### Capitalisation level

The crypto market offers large market cap tokens as well as "penny" tokens with a minuscule total token supply valuation.

Naturally, the larger the market capitalisation, the more established it is considered by the market.

However, do not forget to evaluate tokens based both on _total supply_ and _circulating supply_.

Additionally, a large market capitalisation does not necessarily mean an investment is less risky: the price can drop from higher and dilute your position.

* HIGH: Top 20-30 tokens
* MID: Tokens with a valuation of more than $50-$100 million
* LOW: newly introduced tokens with low valuations
* ICO: Tokens about to be launched by their founders

A strong cryptocurrency portfolio should reflect the current state of the economy and be a healthy mix of ICOs, low, middle and high capitalisation tokens.

### Token generation

Cryptocurrencies have evolved extensively in the past decade.  
While Bitcoin, the first blockchain use case, disrupts the payment industry, other tokens have emerged and improved the scope of the technology.

**1st gen: Payment protocol**

Bitcoin and Litecoin amongst other first-generation tokens provide the same utility to their respective users: the ability to transfer value rapidly from one peer to another.

**2nd gen: Smart contract development**

The second generation, pioneered by Ethereum, enables the development of smart contracts on top of a blockchain.  
More than settling financial transactions, the second generation allows the programming and automation of interactions and facilitates the access to blockchain technology.

**3rd gen: Decentralised applications and tokenised assets**

The third generation relates to tokens that are built on top of an existing blockchain.  
Rather than building a new blockchain from scratch, these tokens leverage already existing platforms to build an application on top of it.
This generation should become the front-end of the decentralisation drive that cryptocurrencies are introducing.

### Consensus

Cryptocurrencies started off with Proof-of-Work consensus where miners invest hardware, energy and time as the resource-draining activities to secure the network and reach distributed consensus.

Alternatively, Proof-of-Stake consensus enables token holders to stake their capital to verify transactions and earn rewards out of it.

Other consensus protocols include Federated Byzantine Agreement, Proof-of-Service or Proof-of-Burn.

There is no optimal consensus protocol yet as the crypto world is still at an early stage, so rather than focusing on only one consensus, make sure you have a stake in a few.

### Location

The same way you would not invest in stocks located in the same country, try to invest in cryptocurrency based on where their operations or most of their users are located.

NEO is a smart contract development blockchain based in China, while OmiseGO caters the payment industry in South East Asia.

Accumulating tokens from China might expose you to unnecessary risk, in the event that China's regulators decide to ban Bitcoin for example.
