Cryptocurrencies have emerged as a new type of asset class for investors. Today, there are over a thousand different ones listed on multiple exchanges.  

Market capitalisation can range from several billion dollars to less than one hundred thousand dollars. As the market is unregulated and fairly new, prices are very volatile and can lead to impressive fluctuations.

When a new technology disrupts markets at scale, it often comes with new rules and fundamentals to follow.


## Disclaimer

### a) Caveat emperor

As the industry is decentralised and permissionless, investors need to follow the "_caveat emperor_" principle.   

In other words, investors need to undertake extensive research before purchasing any token, as there are significant risks that the project will fail on the long run.

It is and will always be the _token way or the highway._

### b) Private keys

Trading in crypto often means trusting a third party exchanges with your assets.  
When storing crypto on exchanges, you do not hold the private keys: therefore you only hold an IOU (I Owe You).   
It is a promise that the exchange will disburse the funds back to you when requested.

Be sure to store most of your crypto on cold storage: if you set up your system well, your tokens will be safe from any digital attacks (but not physical attacks!).

### c) Token utility

Before anything else, tokens should transfer tangible utility to its holders, or at least have utility in a foreseeable future.  
 
**Without utility, a token does not have any form of value.**

Forms of utility or _token functions_ include but are not restricted:

* **Payment:** facilitates peer-to-peer transactions.
* **Incentive:** enables the opportunity to earn dividends.
* **Access:** grants the right to access a product or service.
* **Governance:** ability to vote and participate in decision-making.
* **Asset-back:** claim to physical assets represented by digital tokens.
* **Receipt:** proof that an individual as donated or paid a bill.
* **Ownership:** stake in the project.

It is important to fully understand the token eco-system and competitors before investing in any projects.   

Mind that some decentralised projects can sometimes issue more than one token, which can get confusing for end users.  Be sure to understand what are the specific functions of each of the tokens.

Last but not least, a token that only holds payment functions would be competing with high capitalisation and established cryptocurrency tokens such as Bitcoin, Litecoin, Ripple or Monero. Tough competition, in our opinion.

### d) Fraud, scams, Ponzi schemes, multi-level marketing schemes.

Unfortunately, the cryptocurrency eco-system is flawed with multiple malicious agents and fraudulent projects.

With cryptocurrency, you are not protected against fraud and scams, because no one has the power to rewind a transaction. 

This means once the money is disbursed from your accounts, there is no turning back. It is your responsibility to manage your tokens well, so be careful about fraudulent projects.

It is safe to avoid any investment opportunities that follow the below patterns:

*  Guarantees high returns in no time or promise to become the next Bitcoin. Often leverages website banners and social media campaigns with catchy headlines.

* Does not promote token utility and does not advertise any sort of technology-driven Unique Selling Point.

* Promoted via other investors that share referral links on social media. Multi-level marketing schemes rely on contributors to get new investors onboard via attractive bonuses. This is a strategy derived from pyramid and Ponzi schemes. 

* Any links shared by an unknown individual via direct message on a social media platform. Avoid any direct communication with outsiders as they could promote Ponzi, MLM schemes or attempt to attack your system via phishing and malware attacks.

## New market, new rules

### a) Definitions

#### Crypto terminology

* **Fiat**: Money controlled and monitored by a central bank (dollar, euro, yen).

*  **Cryptocurrency**: Digital money that works on cryptography to secure transactions and create transparently additional units of the currency.

*  **Bitcoin**: First cryptocurrency.

*  **Altcoin**: Cryptocurrencies other than Bitcoin.

#### Investment

* **Portfolio**: Group of financial instruments held by an individual, groups of individuals or institution.

*  **Trade**: Action of buying or selling a currency or an asset.

*  **Position**: Commitment to buy or sell a currency or an asset.

*  **Long**: Hold a position that will profit if the price goes up in the future.

*  **Short**: Hold a position that will profit if the price goes down in the future.


#### Valuation

*  **Market capitalisation**: Total value of a project calculated by multiplying the price of one token by the number of tokens (either circulating or total supply).

*  **Circulating token supply**: Number of tokens that are already generated and available to use. Bitcoin circulating token supply in 2017 is around 16-17 million.

*  **Total token supply**: Number of tokens that will exist whether it is in the future or the present. Bitcoin total token supply is 21 million.


### b)  Time

Markets are open around the clock without interruption.    
However, trading volumes are never constant and subject to variation based on several factors:

*    **Institutional money:** financial institutions only trade during weekdays at conventional working hours.

*    **Geography:** Trading volumes during the day in China or the USA will be higher than at the same time in the Middle East or in the Pacific.

*   **Mainstream media:** Media covering has a huge impact on trading volumes as they influence new investors to enter the market and often spread awareness on cryptocurrencies as a whole.


### c) Unit of account

There are two markets where investors can trade on:

*   **Fiat to established altcoin.**  
Depending on the exchanges, there are approximately a dozen cryptocurrencies you can trade against USD, EUR, CNY or GBP.

*   **Bitcoin or Ethereum to altcoins.**  
Most of the cryptocurrencies are priced in Bitcoin, and some in Ethereum, especially after the Initial Coin Offering boom of 2016-17.

Navigating between both markets can become trivial, but it is important to keep track of every entry and exit price so that you can assess the performance of your positions and portfolio.


### d) Price

*    **Volatility:**  Cryptocurrency trading can become very stressful once you fully comprehend how prices are unstable. It is not uncommon to witness a 50% jump or pull down in price in a matter of few hours.

*    **Liquidity:** Smaller market capitalisation tokens do not have enough volume for constant trading. In this scenario, it is sometimes difficult to exit a position. Be sure to take the aforementioned into account when investing in a low cap coin.


### e) Market capitalisation

Often acknowledged as the main indicator to evaluate the crypto economy, market capitalisations are calculated by the multiplication of the price of one token by the total token supply.

This can be misleading as the _total_ token supply often differs from the _circulating_ supply.  

In a scenario where tokens are pre-mined and held by the founding team, the _circulating_ supply could only represent a fraction of the _total_ supply: the eco-system valuation can, therefore, reach absurd valuations.  

For instance, the circulating token supply of Gnosis, a decentralised prediction market application, represented one-tenth of the total token supply during its initial coin offering.


### f) Inflation

Additionally, some tokens are inflationist and follow a planned emission rate. If more tokens are added to the circulating supply, then the value of outstanding units is diluted.

With cryptocurrencies, the inflation rate is (for serious projects) codified and transparent, allowing investors to estimate the future circulating supply and forecast the future circulating supply valuation.


### g) Trust (due diligence)

The crypto-economy is often referred as decentralised and permissionless, meaning users do not have to trust any third party when interacting with applications.   

However, before a token is floating, users need to trust that the founding team introduced the token fairly and that project development will meet targets.  

Investors need to assess a few features before chipping in:

* Are developers active and aspire to improve the products?
* Does the token provide utility to its holders?
* Are the founding members legit and do they seem trustworthy?
* Is the token distribution transparent and does the market capitalisation reflect the value of the project?


### h) Opportunities

In cryptocurrencies there are two distinct investment opportunities available for investors:

*    **ICO:** there are new projects introduced by a token generating event. Caveat emperor is key, as the founding members establish the rules of the game: it’s their way or the highway.

*   **Floating tokens:** there are already listed on exchanged and are traded around the clock. Price is determined by supply and demand market dynamics.

Floating tokens have dynamics prices while ICOs have a fixed price tag.  

In general, you’ll need to do extra research on ICOs as they are at an earlier stage.  
Once the ICO is completed, exchanges list the ICO token and it becomes a _floating_ token.


##  Profile

An investment strategy tailored to your profile will help you design a better performing portfolio.


### a) Involvement

Not everyone is willing to scan trading charts and keep up to date on a daily basis. Try to estimate how long you are willing to invest in your portfolio.  

It will help you design a portfolio customised to your investment profile.


### b) Risk reward

Cryptocurrency investments can become very volatile, while you can make healthy profits overnight, you are not immune to incurring heavy losses.  
 
Define your risk matrix and to what extent you are willing to enter less established investments.   

Are you risk averse or risk-taking?  

Your portfolio should illustrate your mindset towards risk.


### c) Timeline

Each investment has an entry and an exit.   

It is important for investors to understand when they expect to lock their profit.   

Timelines should also be diversified and depend on your level of involvement.  


### d) Skillset and experience

Since the cryptocurrency market is at such an early stage, very few of us have extensive experience on the matter.  
Still, try to stick to your areas of expertise and to an industry you comprehend.

If you enjoy trading, focus on floating tokens, on the other hand, if you like assessing products maybe ICO investing is a better option.

At tropyc we like to differentiate tokens by industry (gaming, prediction, cloud storage), if you come from an industry with a high cryptocurrency penetration why not invest in the token you deem best fit to disrupt your industry at scale?
