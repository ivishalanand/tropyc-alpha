Once you designed your cryptocurrency portfolio, you might want to make some changes: whether by opening or closing positions. 

In fact, investing is about locking profits or at least minimising your losses - so don't leave your portfolio idle for more than you initially expected, otherwise you might get some surprises.

Remember, no matter what, no trader or algorithm will have the secret recipe to determine by how much the cryptocurrency market will grow (or any market for that matter).

On one side, prices are incredibly volatile compared to conventional markets, and on the other, innovation has been so extreme that cutting-edge blockchain technology is continuously being introduced which may just make some of the recently issued tokens obsolete.

Here's an introduction to portfolio management and rebalancing strategies. This guide should not be considered as investment advice, but instead, as a narrative to educate cryptocurrency enthusiasts about investment strategies.


## DOs and DONTs

No matter what, because of the volatile nature of the cryptocurrency market, the primary objective here - besides making profits - is to protect yourself from the risks of cryptocurrency while investing the least amount of time. 

Here we compiled a list of best practices when investing in the cryptocurrency market.


### a) Fund allocation

Understand how to manage your funds, depending on your profile and market involvement.

#### Investing versus Trading

Investing and Trading are two different approaches to wealth creation in the cryptocurrency market.  
The former considers profitability as a long-term objective, while the latter has a faster turnover.

Investing has a long-term outlook and determines a portfolio based on your risk and timeline expectations to create wealth in the future. You may either invest in floating tokens or newly introduced ones via ICOs / tokensales.

Trading is more about seeking quick opportunities by opening positions with a short lifespan. As the cryptocurrency prices move swiftly, trading can create or dismantle wealth at a faster pace than investing.

In general, investing is more about analysing fundamentals, while trading is about investigating market behaviours.

Overall, do not stick to one strategy: **always keep a balanced portfolio of investing and trading**


#### Fiat and Crypto

Pouring money into the cryptocurrency market does not necessarily mean always _owning_ cryptocurrencies or assets.

As such we recommend always to own a small proportion of your portfolio in fiat, this will reduce your exposition to price volatility.  
In the event the market crashes, you might want to start buying more cryptocurrencies at a lower price.

Consider it as an emergency reserve, which varies based on the state of the market, your risk aversion and trading operations


### b) Position, stop loss, take profit

Most of the traders have more losing trades than winning trades, but manage to have a profitable portfolio.

Losing trades should incur a minimal loss while winning trades should get a high return on investment.

You can bet the price will go up with opening a _long position_ or that the price will go down by opening a _short position_. 

However, before entering a position, it is essential to understand when to close it in both scenarios: whether in profit or loss.   
As such, set your position targets either from a time or price perspective - and stick to them.

A smart way to set-up your positions is to automate your exit depending on market fluctuations.  
As such, most of the exchanges offer Stop Loss and Take Profit trade operations on their platform.

* **Stop Loss:** order to sell/buy an asset to minimise losses.
** Long: triggered when the price goes below a pre-defined price.
** Short: triggered when the price goes above a pre-defined price.

* **Take Profit:** order to sell/buy an asset to reach a profit target.
** Long: triggered when the price goes above a pre-defined price.
** Short: triggered when the price goes below a pre-defined price.


### c) Unit of account

In the previous chapter, we saw there were two different unit of account in cryptocurrency investing: _crypto to fiat_ and _crypto to crypto._

#### Keep it simple

Newcomers might get confused with moving from fiat priced assets to Bitcoin or Ethereum priced assets.  
At first, keep it simple and avoid to switch from fiat to crypto units of account multiple times.  
You might lose track of your performance in the process.

When investing in the crypto/crypto unit of account, the primary goal **is to grow faster than Bitcoin or Ethereum does in fiat.**


#### Avoid long-term arbitrage

Arbitrage is an investment strategy that involves the purchase and the sale of an asset on different markets and exchanges to take advantage of the price variation of the same asset.

It is not uncommon to see a steep variation of prices in the same assets.

For instance, consider the following triangular arbitrage opportunity: 
 
* A fiat exchange lists the price of Bitcoin at 1,000 EUR (remember, remember, when it was cheaper).

* Another exchange lists the price of Shitcoin at 0.01 Bitcoin. 

* The same exchange lists the price of Shitcoin at 110 EUR.

If you (a) buy 1 Bitcoin at 1,000 EUR  (b) sell it off for Shitcoins priced at 0.01 Bitcoin, you will get 10 Shitcoins.  
Finally, (c) you can sell them at 110 EUR each to lock a total profit of 100 EUR.

Arbitrage trading can be very profitable if well operated, however, before stepping in, don't forget to take into account trading and transaction fees (both exchange and network).

Still, we advise you to arbitrage only on an extremely short-term basis. Otherwise, you might overexpose your portfolio to steep price variation.

A long-term triangular arbitrage position is an uncontrolled risk.   
It's a bit like rolling the dice, so be careful!



#### Stick to pairs that make sense

An increasing amount of tokens have been introduced on top of smart contract development blockchains (Ethereum, Waves).

Rather than trading them against Bitcoin, stick to currencies that are intrinsically connected.  Trading an Ethereum blockchain against Bitcoin might overcomplicate your analysis.

For instance, let's have a look at the decentralised predictive market applications: Augur and Gnosis. Both of them are built on top of Ethereum; therefore they have nothing to do with Bitcoin.  
A logical pair would be against Ether and not Bitcoin.

Trading against Bitcoin creates vulnerabilities to your portfolio whenever there are sharp price swings.


### d) Stay informed

News traders try to predict how markets behave after a news release. Making investment decisions based on announcements can become troublesome, as many cryptocurrency focused media outlets are inaccurate or have an agenda. 

For instance, Bitcoin guru Roger Ver owns Bitcoin.com while the Digital Currency Group, a fund that has a stake in ZCash and CoinBase to name a few, has a stake in CoinDesk.  

Many mainstream media houses promote FUD around Bitcoin and the cryptocurrency market, defining it as a Ponzi or a bubble.

Stay aware of what's happening as it might give you a hedge against the market, but be sure to diversify your sources and indicators as below:


#### Chart

Nothing like good old price charts to build up your analysis and forecasts.  

 Keep in mind that past performance does not guarantee future results: a bullish trend can quickly shift into a bearish one!


#### News

The famous saying "Buy the rumour, sell the news" is quite self-explanatory. When news is released, markets _have already moved in accordance to the news_.

You should follow cryptocurrency media houses (Tropyc!, CoinTelegraph, CoinDesk to name a few), as well as financial news (Reuters, Bloomberg, FT) and mainstream media (NYT, Forbes)

Never forget official press released from the developing team. Staying aware and reactive might help you lock a profitable position.



#### Technical indicator

Various indicators can help you shape your analysis and make better investment decisions. 

Cryptocurrency traders have leveraged various indicated including moving averages, RSI and Ichimoku clouds to predict future price movements.

Technical analysis is unfortunately outside of the scope of this article (although we intend to add a guide series soon!)



## Strategy


### a) Hodl

"Hodl" or hold refers to the act of storing and accumulating cryptocurrencies without the intent to sell them against fiat.

Hold On for Dear Life came from an iconic (Bitcointalk post)[https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=375643.0] filled up with grammar mistakes.

Hodl is a unstressful strategy where investors have a long-term mindset without the necessity to check portfolio performance regularly. 

If you "hodl" be sure to store your tokens in a (cold wallet)[/crypto-101/wallets/cold-wallets]


### b) Periodic investments

If investment and trading are not your things, periodic investments might just be the perfect strategy for you.

A planned and periodic investment strategy can automate the purchase of cryptocurrencies and assets.

It consists in investing periodically, the same amount of money in the same crypto asset.

For instance, you may purchase 50$ worth of Bitcoin and 50$ worth Litecoin every Saturday morning when you wake up!

Such strategy can get you into the crypto game without thorough analysis required.  
The main benefit is that, in the long term, your investment is not affected by short-term price swings - depending on the period you chose.


### c) Value Cost Averaging

Value Cost Averaging (VCA) strategies is a safe way to invest in cryptocurrencies while protecting yourself from its dramatic price variations.

This method works on slow and steady investments with minimal involvement from the investor.  
As such, with VCA investors can protect themselves from market fluctuations, low diversification while reducing monitoring time.

So how does it work?

#### Concept

First, start by planning the fundamentals of your future investments:

1. How much money do you want to invest in crypto?
2. During how much time do you want to spread your investment?
3. What are the cryptocurrencies and digital tokens you find worth the money?

For instance, you may want to invest 2,000 EUR during 10 months, on a monthly basis, in the following markets:

* Established payment (Bitcoin, Litecoin)
* Interbank settlement (Ripple, Stellar)
* Smart contract development platforms (Ethereum, Neo)
* Prediction market (Augur, Gnosis)
* Gaming and e-sports (FirstBlood, GameCredits)
* Distributed storage (Sia, Storj)
* Privacy & private marketplace (Monero, Particl)
* Attention economy (Steemit, Basic Attention Token)

If you select one of each, after 10 months, you'll invest a maximum of 250 EUR per token at 25 EUR per token per month.


#### Rebalancing 

In this example,  the average value of each token should increase by 25 EUR every month.
As such, regardless of the price of one token, you have to invest 25 EUR the first month, 50 EUR the second month, 100 EUR the fourth month and so on, until reaching 250 EUR the tenth month.

**1. Month 1**
 
Invest 25 EUR in "Shitcoin" at a price of 1 EUR = 1 SHIT


**2. Month 2**

Depending on the price of SHIT and following VCA strategy you will either buy or sell SHIT.


* Price drop: 1 EUR = 2 SHIT

My 25 EUR investment got wrecked down to 12.5 EUR.  
I need to spend an extra 12.5 EUR to get back to my month 1 target and 25 EUR for month 2 target.   
In this scenario, I'll spend 37.5 EUR.


* Price spike: 1 EUR = .5 SHIT

My 25 EUR investment became a 50 EUR investment.   
I will not buy anymore Shitcoins because I reached my target for month 2.  
In this scenario, I'll spend 0 EUR.


* Price mega spike = 1 EUR = .25 SHIT

My 25 EUR investment became a 100 EUR investment.  
Because I reached my target for month 4 on month 2, I'll have to sell 50 EUR worth of SHIT.  
In this scenario, I'll sell 50 EUR worth of SHIT.

Cryptocurrencies and digital tokens might just change the world, or at least have a lasting impact on our economy.  
Many of them will underperform their expectations, face harsh competition - just like any other start-up.  

But if you play it smart, chances are, your portfolio can do well against fiat.
