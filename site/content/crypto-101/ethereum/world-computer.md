## Centralisation of internet

Ethereum addresses one of the core issues of the web today: trusting third parties.  
The same way Bitcoin is disrupting financial services, Ethereum addresses one of the internet’s core issue: centralisation.
Let’s first have a look at how today's web operates compared with a decentralised model:

{{< img src="crypto-101/infographics/info-eth1-1.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Centralised vs decentralised internet" >}}

The current world wide web framework stores most of the data locally. In other words, when you visit a website you trust a third party to 

* Securely store your information (payment details, browsing history, passwords, identity)
* Keep it safe from attacks (hacks, leaks)
* Avoid using it for illegal commercial purposes (sell to third parties)

The problem here is that there are no ways of monitoring how your information is handled, if it is safe or not, and whether a third party tries to deceive you.
The NSA Snowden case and Wikileaks hack are just examples of what can happen to your personal information.

A decentralised system utilises nodes (computers connected to the network) to validate transactions, instead of centralised “cloud” servers owned by a third party. 
On the right, it creates a permissionless eco-system where end-users do not have to trust one single entity. Rather, the information is cryptographically secured and distributed amongst all the participants of the network that verify its authenticity and record it on the blockchain.

Today we store our data on the cloud, on internet company servers such as Google Drive, Dropbox, Amazon or Box.  

Let's compare both models of online storage:

Decentralisation offers _in theory_ a better file storage opportunity to the end-user: no third party has the control to view, edit, duplicate, delete or lock any files on the cloud.

This methodology can be applied to every product and services. Ethereum aspires to become the “World Computer”: the platform that will enable the transition from a centralised internet to a decentralised one.

## World computer

Bitcoin is the first use case of blockchain technology and has without any doubt disrupted the banking and financial services sector.   However, Bitcoin is just one of the possible applications of a blockchain: the first cryptocurrencies acted as peer-to-peer digital currencies and were therefore limited to financial operations.  

At this time, building decentralised blockchain applications required high skill sets in cryptography, computer science, economics and whatnot.

Ethereum changed that.

Ethereum is an open-source and decentralised software platform, built on a blockchain, which enables development of decentralised applications (DApps) on top of its infrastructure. 

Thanks to Ethereum, developing DApps and issuing tokenised assets have become more accessible and less troublesome than building your own native blockchain.  
The vision is to replace conventional applications - like the ones you can find on the AppStore or Google Play – with decentralised ones, that won’t be governed and controlled by any corporations or centralised entities. 

In theory, no one will be able to control your information and behaviour as the system is considered “trustless” or "permissionless".

How?

Ethereum is famous for introducing programming tools on top of its blockchain to make developer’s life easier.

* **Smart contracts**:  
Programs that can run transparently, in a trustless environment without any middleman. In other words, with smart contracts, you can program stakeholder relationships and automate interactions between them.

* **Tokensale and Initial Coin Offering infrastructure**:   
Simplified framework to issue tokens, design the economics (supply, mining) and plan the crowdfunding exercise (timeline, amount sought).

* **Decentralised Autonomous Organisation (DAO)**:  
Automation of stakeholder relationships within an organisation, powered by smart contracts. For instance, it can grant a voting right, distribute profits or manage assets.

* **Decentralised browsers**:   
The new internet will be decentralised: we will need a new type of browser to surf the web 3.0.

* **Programming language**:  
Solidity is Ethereum's programming language that can deploy DApps and smart contracts on the network. Ethereum gathers an active community that shares libraries, coding frameworks and smart contract development examples.

## Team

How did a decentralised world computer developed on a blockchain manage to go so big? Well, because it is _a bit_ centralised.

The Ethereum Network is being developed and maintained by the Ethereum Foundation a non-for-profit based (legally) out of Switzerland.

In 2013, Vitalik Buterin, 19, first proposed Ethereum as a decentralised mining-cum-software development platform. Although he is not the Executive Director of the foundation, he quickly became the young face of the Ethereum revolution.
