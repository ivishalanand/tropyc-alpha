Bitcoin is the first digital token built on a blockchain and with payment functions.  
Today, there are thousands of different tokens you can hold on a decentralised and secured network.


## What is an Initial Coin Offering, Token Generating Event, tokensale?

No official definitions differentiate the three terms mentioned above. Therefore we decided to consider them for now as _interchangeable_.

No matter what, they represent new generation fundraising mechanisms, that operate without an intermediate in the process. 

* Bitcoin facilitates payment between two peers. 
* ICO facilitates fundraising between multiple peers

A company can raise funds by issuing a digital token to its investors, granting their holder with either a right, ownership or both.  

It has drawn a lot of attention in 2016, mainly because of its ability to help early-stage ventures raise considerable funds in cryptocurrencies.


## What’s new in an ICO?

In Venture Capital and Angel Investing, investors purchase ownership of a company in exchange for expected returns in the future, achieved during an exit – would it be an IPO, acquisition or merger.  

However, in conventional startup investments, equity is illiquid until the exit occurs – this makes a start-up investment risky compared to other traditional securities.  


### Liquid

ICOs give a chance to early investors to turn an illiquid asset liquid.  
One can easily exchange tokens released by ICOs/TGEs/tokensales to other parties after the end of the crowdsale.  

Because start-up investment has now become illiquid, it reduces an investor's risk substantially. 


### Accessible

Venture capital investments have now become accessible to any investors irrespective of their net worth.  
Beforehand, only Angel Investors and Venture Capital were able to pour capital in start-ups.  

For instance, if a start-up needed to raise half a million dollars, only wealthy institutions and individuals were able to bear the investment. Today, you can invest as a low as $100 in a tokensale.


### Diverse

Digital tokenised assets may offer more than company ownership, as depicted in the Venture Capital model.  

Here, tokens can represent either an asset or a currency:

* Cryptocurrency: a new kind of monetary instrument secured with a blockchain. Its value is derived from the blockchain itself. 

* Crypto-asset: a digital token issued on a cryptocurrency blockchain. The value is not derived from the blockchain but from an activity, an organisation or a behaviour.

Furthermore, tokens can hold a multitude of functions such as voting rights or claims to physical assets, as long as it can be programmed.


## Why should I care?

Just like Bitcoin facilitates peer-to-peer payment services, ICO/TGE/tokensale offer a decentralised approach to fundraising.

You can invest in a project with as much as you want and without any time constraints.

Of course, the real innovation here resides in issuing a token that provides a set of diverse functions to its holder, more than just representing a simple stake in a project or venture.  

For instance, mutual funds could incorporate the technology and issue tokens to their investors. More than a venture, the mutual fund would create an entire decentralised eco-system where investors could track their capital, have a voting power over the whole pool and much more.

It can get complicated to conceptualise as digital tokens have very few active use-cases and are outside of the realm of regulatory policy.

Overall, this new investment instrument has been possible because of blockchain’s disruptive technology and its application of cryptography.
