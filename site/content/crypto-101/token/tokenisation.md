Bitcoin is the first digital token, with payment functions, built on a blockchain.
Today, there are thousands of different tokens you can hold on a decentralised and secured network.

## What is a token sale or ICO/ITO/TGE?

Token sales, Initial Coin Offering, Initiat Token Offering and Token Generating Event do not have official definitions to differentiate them.  
Therefore we decided to consider them, for now, as _interchangeable_.

No matter what, they represent new generation fundraising mechanisms, that operate without an intermediate in the process.

* Bitcoin facilitates payment between two peers.
* ICO/ITO/TGE/Token sale facilitates fundraising between multiple peers.

A company can raise funds by issuing a digital token to its investors, granting their holder with either a right, ownership or both.

It has drawn a lot of attention in 2016, mainly because of its ability to help early-stage ventures raise considerable funds in cryptocurrencies.

## What's the difference between a coin, a token and a cryptocurrency?

A cryptocurrency is a digital form of money that is encrypted (and therefore secured) by cryptography. Bitcoin is the first cryptocurrency that is decentralised and ran on a blockchain.

Coins and tokens are not necessarily cryptocurrencies, as they might not be leveraging cryptographic encryption.

There are no "official" crypto-economy definitions, but we propose:

* Coin derive their value from the blockchain and can operate independently.
* Tokens are built on top of an existing blockchain and are not involved in the process of reaching consensus.

## What’s new in a token sale?

In Venture Capital and Angel Investing, investors purchase ownership of a company in exchange for expected returns in the future, achieved during an exit – would it be an IPO, acquisition or merger.

However, in conventional startup investments, equity is illiquid until the exit occurs – this makes a start-up investment risky compared to other traditional securities.

### Liquid

ICOs give a chance to early investors to turn an illiquid asset liquid.
One can easily exchange tokens released by ICOs/TGEs/tokensales to other parties after the end of the crowdsale.

Because start-up investment has now become illiquid, it reduces an investor's risk substantially.

### Accessible

Venture capital investments have now become accessible to any investor irrespective of their net worth.  
Before, only Angel Investors and Venture Capitalists were able to pour capital in start-ups.

For instance, if a start-up needed to raise half a million dollars, only wealthy institutions and individuals were able to bear the investment. Today, you can invest as a low as $100 in a tokensale.

### Diverse

Digital tokenised assets may offer more than company ownership, as depicted in the Venture Capital model.

Here, tokens can represent either an asset or a currency:

* Cryptocurrency: a new kind of monetary instrument secured with a blockchain. Its value is derived from the blockchain itself.

* Crypto-asset: a digital token issued on a cryptocurrency blockchain. The value is not derived from the blockchain but from an activity, an organisation or a behaviour.

Furthermore, tokens can hold a multitude of functions such as voting rights or claims to physical assets, as long as it can be programmed.

## Why should I care?

Just like Bitcoin facilitates peer-to-peer payment services, ICO/TGE/token-sale offer a decentralised approach to fundraising.

You can invest in a project with as much as you want and without any time constraints.

Of course, the real innovation here resides in issuing a token that provides a set of diverse functions to its holder, more than just representing a simple stake in a project or venture.

For instance, mutual funds could incorporate the technology and issue tokens to their investors. More than a venture, the mutual fund would create an entire decentralised eco-system where investors could track their capital, have a voting power over the whole pool and much more.

It can get complicated to conceptualise as digital tokens have very few active use-cases and are outside of the realm of regulatory policy.

Overall, this new investment instrument has been possible because of blockchain’s disruptive technology and its application of cryptography.
