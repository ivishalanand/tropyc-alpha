## What is a cryptocurrency?

It is a digital form of money that is encrypted (and therefore secured) by cryptography. Bitcoin is the first cryptocurrency that is decentralised and runs on a blockchain.  

Bitcoin is the first digital cryptocurrency, with payment functions, built on a blockchain.
Today, there are thousands of other ones you can hold on a decentralised and secured network. All of them, besides Bitcoin, are called alternative coins or "altcoin".

## What is the difference between a coin and a token?

Coins and tokens are not necessarily cryptocurrencies, as they might not be leveraging cryptographic encryption.
There are no "official" crypto-economy definitions, but we propose:

* **Coins** derive their value from the blockchain and can operate independently.
* **Tokens** are built on top of an existing blockchain and are not involved in the process of reaching consensus.

Therefore a token is built **_on top of_** a coin.

## What is an ICO?

An Initial Coin Offering (ICO) is a new generation fundraising mechanism that operates without the need of an intermediary.  
Individuals and organisations can both raise funds and invest via cryptocurrencies without a broker.

The term "ICO" has become the most prevalent terminology in the industry to qualify a decentralised crowdsale - although some introduce "tokens" rather than "coins". 

However, many start-ups have decided to change slightly the language, shifting to Initial Token Offering, Token Generating Event or token sales. One of the main reasons could be the correlation between "ICO" and "investment opportunity" and therefore "regulated security".

Therefore we have decided to consider them, for now, as _interchangeable_, until an official legal statement from a major regulator.

## What’s new in an ICO?

ICO and Bitcoin have different functions: 

* Bitcoin facilitates payment between two peers.
* ICO/ITO/TGE/Token sale facilitate fundraising between multiple peers.

The technology has drawn a lot of attention in mainstream media by 2016, mainly because of its ability to help early-stage ventures raise considerable funds in cryptocurrencies.

Investors purchase ownership of a company in exchange for expected returns in the future. Returns occur after an exit, it can be an IPO, acquisition or merger.

In conventional startup investments, equity is illiquid until the exit occurs – this makes a start-up investment risky compared to other traditional securities.

### Liquid

ICOs give a chance to early investors to turn an illiquid asset liquid.  
One can easily exchange tokens released by ICOs/TGEs/tokensales to other parties after the end of the crowdsale.

Because start-up investment has now become illiquid, it reduces an investor's risk substantially.

### Accessible

Venture capital investments have now become accessible to any investor irrespective of their net worth.  
Before, only Angel Investors and Venture Capitalists were able to pour capital in start-ups.

For instance, if a start-up needed to raise half a million dollars, only wealthy institutions and individuals were able to cover the investment. Today, you can invest as little as $100 in a token sale.

### Diverse

Digital assets may offer more than company ownership, as depicted in the Venture Capital model.

They can hold a multitude of functions such as voting rights, claims to physical assets or access to a private marketplace as long as it can be programmed and stored on a digital device.
