Digital tokens create a neoteric relationship between the token holder and the organisation that issues it in the first place.

Rather than defining token holders as shareholders of a venture, they can potentially be any stakeholder involved with a project: users, investors, employees, founders…  
They enable flexible interactions between internal and external stakeholders of an application, organisation or an asset.

As the concept is very new, not enough case studies have emerged around the issuance of rights or entitlements to holders, to comprehend how it will impact our economy and society.

Cryptocurrencies give the opportunity to transfer value (asset or right) at any point in time. Therefore, token holders are not locked in their positions and can quickly sell their digital assets whenever they want, even hours after its creation.  
The technology offers new economic rules and paradigms, often introduced after the completion of an ICO/TGE/token sale.

Here, we discuss tokenomics: the economics of digital tokens.

## Macroeconomics

### Supply

Token issuance relates to the creation of a digital asset and the execution of incremental units.
Token supply can be either _fixed_ like Bitcoin or _unlimited_ like Ether.

The distribution should be fair, transparent and immutable.
While the concept of “fair distribution” is subjective, it is important to underline that the token founding team is the only economic agent that designs the token dynamics.

When purchasing a token, investors agree _informally_ to the token distribution as they have no power to change them (remember, a blockchain is immutable!).

Here are the variables to take into consideration when assessing token supplies.

#### Pre-mining

Some projects pre-mine tokens behind closed doors before introducing them to the public.  
Depending on how it is operated, this practice can be controversial as founders decide to reward themselves, advisors or early investors in their own token.
The controversy is not whether or not to pre-mine token, but if the process is transparent.

#### Token supply

While some have no maximum, others have a ceiling limit.  
Evaluating the market capitalisation of a token can, therefore, become a tricky task.

There are two methods:

* Total supply: every token that will exist in the future.
* Circulating supply: tokens that exist in the present.

#### Token generation and inflation rate

How are the tokens created? The consensus mechanism can follow several types of rules: Proof-of-Work, Proof-of-Stake etc.
Most importantly, the mechanism needs to be open-source.

However, transparency can still lead to confusion, especially for less tech-savvy individuals.

Two metrics can help you understand the tokenomics of an eco-system:

* Present circulating rate: circulating supply / total supply
* 5-year inflation rate: circulating supply in 5 years / circulating supply

#### Token distribution

Last but not least, you need to understand how the token is distributed in the first place.  
Distribution can get confusing, sometimes misleading, so be sure to fully comprehend how many tokens are allocated to each stakeholders involved in the project.

Most of the time, the tokens introduced during an ICO do not represent the entire supply: many projects reward founders, advisors and early investors with their own token in addition to the funds raised during the ICO.

### Initial valuation (start-up, currency, floating ICO,...)

The team behind the ICO decides the valuation of the token eco-system.  
In fact, they set the rules of the game: _it’s their way or the highway_.

The amount sought by the founding team often has a price ceiling, and a price floor called _soft cap_ and _hard cap_ respectively.  
Under the hood, a smart contract automatically reimburses investments whenever the final capitalisation comes up outside of the pre-defined brackets.

However, soft and hard caps are not negotiated but solely decided by the founding team itself. Naturally, since founders evaluate their own work, there are considerable risks of over-valuation.

Finally, keep in mind that in some cases, the initial valuation is priced in cryptocurrency rather than in fiat.  
In fact, many ICOs fundraise and fix their soft and hard market capitalisation in a cryptocurrency unit of account.  
As such, if an ICO is live during two weeks, a price fluctuation could have a massive impact on the market capitalisation of the ICO.

An increasing amount of ICOs are switching from a cryptocurrency unit of account to a fiat one, in order to reduce volatility risks for investors.

### Floating market capitalisation

When tokens are disbursed to investor’s wallets, at the end of an ICO, token holders have the choice to either store or sell their digital assets.  
As such, as long as investors want to purchase or sell tokens, the price per unit is floating and subject to supply and demand market dynamics.

The token eco-system valuation becomes volatile in cryptocurrency and even more in fiat.

An investor has to consider two risks:

* Venture risk or success of the enterprise, priced by the token/cryptocurrency pair. (ICO / Ether)
* Cryptocurrency volatility risk or fluctuation of the cryptocurrency used to invest in the ICO, priced by the cryptocurrency/fiat pair. (Ether / USD)

While established crypto-currencies and crypto-assets have substantial daily volume, new tokens typically have lower market metrics.  
It is of prime concern for investors as the lower the capitalisation and volume, the more vulnerable a token is to market manipulation.

### Risks

Malicious traders holding significant capital can engage in wash trading and pump & dumps.

* Wash trading is the act of purchasing and selling an asset simultaneously to confuse other investors and create misleading and artificial operations (i.e.: buying on one exchange and selling on another).

* Pumping is the act of boosting the purchase orders to trigger artificial growth and galvanise the inflow of new investors.
Then, once the value has inflated, the token can be dumped for profits by malicious traders.

## Microeconomics

### Utility

Tokens may have several functionalities and entitle users to a security and/or a right. Each token is unique to a project’s eco-system, specific to a blockchain and can serve different purposes to its holders.

Holding a token that has utility gives “usefulness” to the user when consuming a good or a service.  
Within the decentralised eco-system, one should ask if the digital token is a crucial part of the business model and if it gives some satisfaction to its holder.  
A token that gives rights to ownership over a corporation, debt, or project is considered a security.

### Exit

Token holders can initiate investment exit without an extensive process, as they are available on both primary and secondary markets:

* Primary markets: distributed at source via an ICO, TGE, token sale
* Secondary markets: exchanges, peer-to-peer

If an investor decides to exit an investment position in a token, he can either sell it on a specialised cryptocurrency exchange or directly to a peer.

In fact, because exchanges list most of the digital tokens, it has become relatively easy to enter an investment position in the crypto-economy. However, not all of them achieve stable liquidity.

### Privacy

The cryptocurrency economy delivers a privacy-focused experience to users thanks to its cryptographic features.

Today, you may acquire and trade digital tokens without going through extensive Know Your Customer processes.
In fact, if well set-up, you can stay pseudonymous and have rights over a financial organisation’s behaviour securely - something unimaginable in 2000.
