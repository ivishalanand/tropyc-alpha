Decentralised projects along with their digital assets can be tricky to comprehend, as they can hold different functions and be distributed in various ways - sometimes unfairly.

In some cases, decentralised applications issue multiple assets - each of them holding different functions that enable various types of interactions.  
It is not uncommon for ICOs with more than one token, to differentiate "security" tokens (gives ownership in the company) and "utility" tokens (grants a right to its holder).

Overall, the sum of all the tokens secured by the same blockchain is called a _token eco-system_.

Projects typically document their token eco-system on a scientific paper known as "whitepaper".

## Types of crypto

There are two types of digital assets in the crypto and blockchain economy.

### Native

Native coins and their blockchain have no value independently as both are inseparable.

The blockchain’s core function is to track and record transactions of native coins between peers. Furthermore, miners and stakers earn transaction fees and mining rewards in native coins.

Therefore, the blockchain would not exist without its native coin and vice versa.

Examples of native coins: Bitcoin, Litecoin, Ether, Monero.

### Secondary

Tokens are not built on their own blockchain.

At first, cryptocurrency developers had to create new blockchains for new projects, a process that required a broad array of skills including cryptography, advanced computer science and mathematics.

Today, there are many blockchains, protocols and platforms with easy to use software development kits that facilitate the issuance of new tokens.  
Rather than building everything from scratch, developers are provided with a safe environment for tokens to be deployed and mature.

Examples of blockchain platforms: Ethereum, Neo, Waves, Omni  
Examples of secondary tokens: Gnosis, Bancor

## Functions

Digital assets issued during a ICO/TGE/token-sale can have many functions.
Here we present potential token functions but keep in mind that they are a very new concept.
Today, their potential is far from being fully exploited.

### Medium of exchange

Just like a coin, a token can facilitate a transactional economy between peers.

On a fictive marketplace called TRADE, users may sell and purchase goods and services by using the token TRADE.
Here, the token would be considered as “money” and utilised as a medium of exchange and transfer of value.

Limitations include high price volatility against fiat prices, which may create substantial risks for buyers and sellers.

### Access

It can give access to a decentralised application, a platform, a service or a product.

For instance, by holding a fictive token called TRADE, you may be able to access a decentralised marketplace where users can exchange goods and services privately, securely and without any intermediate in the process.

### Ownership

Centralised financial exchanges help investors facilitate the purchase and sale of instruments such as stocks, bonds or derivatives.  Tokens can also transfer value but without a third party involved in the middle.

Moreover, investing in a start-up might suggest a cumbersome legal and financial process before the issuance of a shareholder agreement.

Ownership tokens, which are often regulated as under security law, can speed up the issuance and transfer of equity between interested parties.

### Incentives

Tokens can give the right to claim additional tokens as a form of incentivising mechanism.

For instance, a fictive asset management firm might issue a token EARN to its investors. On a quarterly basis, investors might be entitled to return on their initial investment.
In this scenario, investors could earn dividends in EARN token rather than in fiat.

Generally, a token with incentive functions also holds medium of exchange functions.

### Fuel

Just like Ether is considered as “digital fuel”, many other tokens can have similar functionalities.
Smart contract development platforms require “fuel” to send and run lines of code on a decentralised virtual machine (computer plugged on the network).

Fuel tokens incentivise developers to deploy efficient code (long code requires more fuel) and reduce spamming and attacks.

### Governance

Decentralised Autonomous Organisation can automate interactions and establish new relationships between stakeholders.
As such, a token can grant to its holders the power to vote and streamline any decision-making process in an organisation.

For instance, asset management DAOs can issue tokens to its investors, depending on how much they chipped in.
Token holders can then vote for projects they believe worth investing. Of course, their “vote weights” are pre-determined by the DAO rules, coded in a smart contract.

### Community

Similar to governing functions, tokens can help stakeholders interact amongst each other within a tokenised eco-system focused on content curation.

For instance, decentralised social media applications can grant the ability to readers to reward publishers and content creators fairly with a token.
Such tokens could also facilitate digital media operations such as likes, shares or comments.

### Asset-backed

Asset-backed tokens are similar to “I Owe You” (I Owe You) financial instruments, a promise of settling a transaction in the future.

In a blockchain context, a token can represent an asset that can be claimed from the token issuer.
For instance, one unit of the fictive token GOLD can represent one ounce of gold, and be exchanged digitally between stakeholders without actually moving anything physically.

Asset-backed tokens make immovable assets _digitally transferable_, however, the token has value only if it can be exchanged with the asset easily.
This process requires thorough due diligence and monitoring, as fraudulent projects could easily deny claims on assets.

For instance, if the token GOLD does not facilitate a rapid and easy way to claim a pre-determined physical amount of gold, the token loses its utility.
It becomes an asset-backed token backed by … nothing.

### Donation

Last but not least, a token can be issued as a proof of payment or donation.
In the future, we might receive a token after contributing to a local charity or after paying up our tax dues.
In this scenario, these tokens would be useful for compliance and audit purposes.

Tokens can hold a combination of the above functions. We recommend you to fully understand both the token eco-system and the functions of the tokens before purchasing any.

The most conventional and easy to grasp tokens are “ownership” ones.
However, such digital assets are considered by many jurisdictions as a security and therefore are regulated by legal frameworks.  It is not because most of them are unregulated today that they will stay unregulated tomorrow.
