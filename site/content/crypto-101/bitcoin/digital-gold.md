## Open-source money

>Writing a description for this thing for general audiences is bloody hard. There's nothing to relate it to." – Satoshi Nakamoto, creator of Bitcoin

With Bitcoin, you can send money - digitally and securely - without relying on a third party (bank, payment gateway, card issuers).  
It is the first currency that operates safely and independently from government authority.

Also known as "cryptocurrency", these new kinds of financial instruments offer an alternative to currencies controlled by central banks, as they are encrypted (and therefore secured) by cryptography.

To put it simply, Bitcoin is the first decentralised financial system that works.

### Traditional or fiat economy

* Issued and regulated by a government, a centralised financial authority.
* It has value because the law makes it legal tender.
* Central banks can print fiat money endlessly and without any limit.
* Transferred from and to personal bank accounts, but managed by third parties (your bank).
* No transparency: after 2008,  central banks printed trillions of dollars, and yet there is no knowledge on how the funds were used.
* Low Privacy: payment companies, tax regulators and banks all have access to your financial life.
Example  = USD, GBP, EUR, INR, CNY

### Decentralised or crypto economy

* Independent from any central banks, no one "owns" the Bitcoin network.
* Rate of emission is fixed, transparent and immutable. Bitcoin issue will be no more than 21 million.
* Users transact without the need of middle men or a third party.
* Transactions are secured by encrypted digital signature and made possible by cryptography and algorithms.
* Perfect transparency: everyone has access to every transaction that occurred on the network.
* Flexible privacy: you can choose to store your wealth anonymously.
Example  = Bitcoin, Litecoin, Ether, Monero etc ...

<p class="font-weight-bold text-center mt-5"> Four reasons why cryptocurrencies are superior to fiat.</p>

1. **Trusting third party**  
You are obliged to trust a bank to hold your wealth in fiat currencies, whereas with Bitcoin, you are the sole owner of your digital coins and do not have to trust anyone to store them.

2. **Planned emission rate**  
Central banks regulate their respective currencies and have the power to inflate or dilute the total supply. (FED in the USA, ECB in Europe, BOE in the UK, RBI in India etc...).  
On the other hand, Bitcoin future emission is planned, immutable and not controlled by a centralised authority.

3. **Transparent disbursement**  
In fiat, we are not aware of how governments and large financial institutions spend freshly issued money.  
Bitcoin addresses this issue by storing every single transaction on a distributed ledger, called the blockchain, which is available to everyone.  

4. **Private transactions**  
Bitcoin holders have the choice to dissociate their wealth and their identity - something not possible with a traditional bank account as there is extensive Know Your Customer (KYC) compliance.

## Founder

>"I've been working on a new electronic cash system that's fully peer-to-peer, with no trusted third party..." - Satoshi Nakamoto.

"Satoshi Nakamoto" is the name used by the inventor or the group of inventors who created Bitcoin and managed its early development. Satoshi's last communication was around 2013 via a forum post.

In 2008, Satoshi Nakamoto published "Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System", and introduced to the world the concept of decentralised money. In 2009, Bitcoin launched.

The Bitcoin protocol only came to notice to a wider audience in 2010, when Slashdot published a piece on the new technology.

Bitcoin is the most famous cryptocurrency and the largest one by market capitalisation. Today, there are over a thousand cryptocurrencies and digital assets.

      This means you can split a Bitcoin into 100,000,000 units, aka Satoshi.

Bitcoin offers an alternative to our financial system: it removes the concept of a middleman in a monetary transaction.

Bitcoin is to banks, what e-mails are to postal services.

## Features

Let's review some of Bitcoin's core value propositions.

      <h3>Speed</h3>
      <p>Transferring cryptocurrencies can be as fast as sending an e-mail. You do not need banks, payment gateways or transaction agents.</p>

    </div>
    <div class="col text-left">
      <h3>Accessible </h3>
      <p>Unlike bank accounts, there is no prerequisites, screening process, charging structures, consumer limits, nor account freezing. You have complete control over your capital.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>


<div class="container my-5">
  <div class="row align-items-center">
    <div class="col text-left">
      <h3>Safe</h3>
      <p>Bitcoins stored in wallets are all only accessible to their owners. On the other hand, funds stored in a traditional bank accounts are vulnerable to bank insolvency, freeze, seize and inflation.</p>

    </div>
    <div class="col text-left">
      <h3>Cheap</h3>
      <p>There are no brokers or third party agents involved in the process, making the transaction fees considerably lower and more straightforward than with fiat.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>


<div class="container my-5">
  <div class="row align-items-center">
    <div class="col text-left">
      <h3>Global</h3>
      <p>Just like the internet, bitcoin has no borders and belongs to no country. Geography is never taken into account in transaction fees.</p>

      <h3>Transparent</h3>
      <p>The Bitcoin blockchain records every transaction on an open-source distributed ledger along with the funds stored in every "Bitcoin account". Everyone knows how many Bitcoin are kept in wallets and when an operation occurs.</p>
