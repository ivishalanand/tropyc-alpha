## The first cryptocurrency

<blockquote class="blockquote">
  <p>"Bitcoin is open-source money."</p>
</blockquote>

You can send money - digitally and securely - without relying on a third party (bank, payment gateway, card issuers). It is the first currency that operates safely and independently from government authority.
Also known as "cryptocurrency", these new kinds of financial instruments offer an alternative to currencies controlled by central banks.

To put it simply, Bitcoin is the first decentralised financial system that works.

### Traditional or fiat economy

* Issued and regulated by a government, a centralised financial authority.
* It has value because the law makes it legal tender.
* Central banks can print fiat money endlessly and without any limit.
* Transferred from and to personal bank accounts, but managed by third parties (your bank).
* No transparency: after 2008,  central banks printed trillions of dollars, and yet there is no knowledge on how the funds were used.
* Low Privacy: payment companies, tax regulators and banks all have access to your financial life.
Example  = USD, GBP, EUR, INR, CNY

### Decentralised or crypto economy

* Independent from any central banks, no one "owns" the Bitcoin network.
* Rate of emission is fixed, transparent and immutable.
<p>There will be 21 million Bitcoins, not more than that.</p>
* Users transact without the need of middle men or a third party.
* Transactions are secured by encrypted digital signature and made possible by cryptography and algorithms.
* Perfect transparency: everyone has access to every transaction that occurred on the network.
* Flexible privacy: you can choose to store your wealth anonymously.
Example  = Bitcoin, Litecoin, Ether, Monero etc ...

<p class="font-weight-bold text-center mt-4"> We can identify three main differences between them:</p>

1. **Trusting third party**
You are obliged to trust a bank to hold your wealth in fiat currencies, whereas with Bitcoin, you are the sole owner of your digital coins and do not have to trust anyone to store them.

2. **Planned emission rate**
Central banks regulate their respective currencies and have the power to inflate or dilute the total supply. (FED in the USA, ECB in Europe, BOE in the UK, RBI in India etc...).  
On the other hand, Bitcoin future emission is planned, immutable and not controlled by a centralised authority.

3. **Transparent disbursement**
In fiat, we are not aware of how governments and large financial institutions spend freshly issued money.  
Bitcoin addresses this issue by storing every single transaction on a distributed ledger, available to anyone called *the blockchain*.  
Additionally, Bitcoin holders have the choice to dissociate their wealth and their identity - something not possible with a traditional bank account as Know Your Customer (KYC) requirements are strict.

## Founder

In 2008, Bitcoin was invented and mathematically proven by an anonymous author nicknamed “Satoshi Nakamoto”.  
Supported by a team of developers and managed by Satoshi, the Bitcoin protocol came to notice in 2011 in mainstream media.

It is the most famous cryptocurrency and the largest one by market capitalisation.  
Mind that there are now over a thousand cryptocurrencies and crypto assets.

      One bitcoin is divisible to the 8th pace.
      This means you can split a Bitcoin into 100,000,000 units, aka Satoshi.

      There will be only 21 million Bitcoins mined – and 99% of them will be available by 2031.

Bitcoin offers an alternative to our financial system: it removes the concept of a middleman in a monetary transaction.   
It is the same way we were able to send messages via e-mail without the need for a third party postal service.  

You can now do the same ... but with money.


## Features

Let's review some of Bitcoin's core value propositions.

      <h3>Speed</h3>
      <p>Sending bitcoin to anyone as quick as you can send an e-mail, without the need for banks or transaction agents.</p>

    <div class="col text-left">
      <h3>Accessible </h3>
      <p>Unlike bank accounts, there is no prerequisites, screening process, charging structures, consumer limits, nor account freezing. You have complete control over your capital.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>


<div class="container my-5">
  <div class="row align-items-center">
    <div class="col text-left">
      <h3>Safe</h3>
      <p>Only the ones having access to wallets own the Bitcoins stored in it, and no one else. On the other hand, funds stored in a traditional bank accounts are vulnerable to bank insolvency, freeze, seize and inflation.</p>

    </div>
    <div class="col text-left">
      <h3>Cheap</h3>
      <p>There are no brokers or third party agents involved in the process, making the transaction fees considerably lower and more straightforward than in fiat.</p>

<div class="container my-5">
  <div class="row align-items-center">

      <h3>Global</h3>
      <p>Just like the internet, bitcoin has no borders and belongs to no country. Geography is never taken into account in transaction fees...</p>

      <h3>Transparent</h3>
      <p>The Bitcoin blockchain records every transaction on an open-source distributed ledger along with the funds stored in every public address. Everyone knows how many Bitcoin are kept in wallets and when an operation occurs.</p>
