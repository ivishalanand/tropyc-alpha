## Store

Bitcoins are stored electronically in digital wallets, similarly to how we store cash in traditional wallets.
The act of "sending a bitcoin" requires 3 things :

<div class="container my-3">
  <div class="row text-center mb-3">
    <div class="col">
     	{{< img src="crypto-101/icons/public-address.svg" class="img-fluid" alt="Mailbox" >}}
     	<p class="font-weight-bold">Public address</p>
     	<p class="small">A string of 26-35 characters that holds Bitcoin. The amount of Bitcoins kept on any public address is available on the blockchain</p>
    </div>
    <div class="col">
     	{{< img src="crypto-101/icons/key.svg" class="img-fluid" alt="Key" >}}
     	<p class="font-weight-bold">Private key</p>
     	<p class="small">A string that proves to the network that you are the owner of a public address's balance</p>
    </div>
    <div class="col">
     	{{< img src="crypto-101/icons/password.svg" class="img-fluid" alt="Password lock" >}}
     	<p class="font-weight-bold">Password</p>
     	<p class="small">Optional. If you store your private keys in an encrypted wallet, you'll need to input a password to unlock it</p>

      <h3>Public address</h3>
      <p>A public address stores Bitcoins and is used to send and receive funds. In other words, a public address serves as a cryptocurrency bank account.</p>
      <p>All the transaction information between public addresses is available to everyone, and accessible online on a decentralised ledger called the blockchain.</p>
      <p>Therefore, everyone knows how much Bitcoins a public address holds. Make sure to generate a new public address when someone pays you in Bitcoin, otherwise … he/she will know how much you have!</p>

    </div>
    <div class="col-8 text-left">
      <h3>Private key</h3>
      <p>Each public address is associated with a private key that unlocks the funds held on it.  In this sense, only the owner of funds stored in a public address has access to the associated private key.</p>
      <p>When a transaction is issued, the network performs a mathematical algorithm to verify whether the pair is correct. If a private key is made public then the funds are compromised - as anyone could issue a transaction.</p>
      <p>You can generate unlimited public address and private key pairs.</p>

<div class="container my-4">
  <div class="row align-items-center">
    <div class="col-8 text-left">
     	<h3>Password</h3>
      <p>Most wallets protect your private keys by encryption with a passphrase. In order to unlock the wallet and get access to private keys, you need to provide a password. Paper wallets are an exception, as they are to put it simply just a sheet of paper with both a private key and a public address. Technically speaking you do not need a password to issue a Bitcoin transaction but rather to unlock the access to private keys stored in a wallet.
      <p>Write down your private key / passphrase, keep it safe and make sure you have a back-up in case you lose it.</p>
      <p>Without backup, forgetting your wallet's password means losing access to your private keys and therefore your Bitcoins.</p>
      <p>In addition to passwords, you may set up 2-Factor Authentication on another device if you wish an extra layer of protection. </p>

## Buy Bitcoin

Owning Bitcoins has become easier by the day. 
Now that you want to get hold of some bitcoins, here are several ways to purchase some.

<div class="container my-5">
  <div class="row align-items-center">
    <div class="col text-left">
     	<h3>Exchange</h3>
      Just like the stock and bond market exchange, you can buy cryptocurrencies on a specialised cryptocurrency exchange. An exchange acts as a centralised marketplace and lets you swap fiat with cryptocurrencies at a given rate - decided by the market.
    </div>
    <div class="col text-center">
      {{< img src="crypto-101/icons/exchange.svg" class="img-fluid" alt="Currency swap" >}}
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<div class="container my-5">
  <div class="row align-items-center">
    <div class="col text-center">
    	{{< img src="crypto-101/icons/atm.svg" class="img-fluid" alt="ATM" >}}
    </div>
    <div class="col text-left">
    	<h3>ATM</h3>
      Purchase Bitcoins with new generation cryptocurrency ATMs. These kiosks are located in major urban hubs and let you buy Bitcoins without any Know Your Customer (KYC) verification.
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<div class="container my-5">
  <div class="row align-items-center">
    <div class="col text-left">
    	<h3>Over the counter</h3>
      As opposed to centralised exchanges, you can join a dealers network and purchase some Bitcoins over-the-counter. This method is useful for large bulk purchases.
    </div>
    <div class="col text-center">
    	{{< img src="crypto-101/icons/over-the-counter.svg" class="img-fluid" alt="Merchant selling goods" >}}
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<div class="container my-5">
  <div class="row align-items-center">
    <div class="col text-center">
      {{< img src="crypto-101/icons/handshake.svg" class="img-fluid" alt="Handshake" >}}
    </div>
    <div class="col text-left">
    	<h3>Peer-to-peer</h3>
     	Bitcoin is digital cash at the end of the day. You can exchange some Bitcoins with fiat from friends and family, as long as you trust your transactor. There are risks of changing currencies with someone you do not know (physical attack ...), the same applies with bitcoin and cryptocurrencies.
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

## Spend

Today, you can buy anything you want with Bitcoins.

<div class="container my-4">
  <div class="row align-items-center">
    <div class="col text-left">
    	<h3>Merchants</h3>
     	<p>An increasing number of merchants accept bitcoins as a form of payment, including some billion dollar revenue powerhouses.</p>
     	<p>Shopify, Microsoft, Expedia to name a few.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="col text-center">
    	{{< img src="crypto-101/icons/brands1.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Microsoft Expedia Dell Shopify" >}}
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<div class="container my-4">
  <div class="row align-items-center">
    <div class="col text-center">
    	{{< img src="crypto-101/icons/card.svg" class="img-fluid" alt="Card" >}}
    </div>
    <div class="col text-left">
    	<h3>Gift cards</h3>
     	<p>You can purchase many gift cards with Bicoins on platforms such as eGifter or Gyft.</p>
     	<p>With them, you can now access an even larger pool of merchants including Starbucks, DunkinDonuts, Walmart or Gap.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<div class="container my-4">
  <div class="row align-items-center">
    <div class="col text-left">
    	<h3>Marketplace</h3>
    	<p>At first, Bitcoin transactions kicked off on the Dark web, used by illegal marketplaces and gambling platforms. Today, most of them are still up and running, meaning you can order any illicit products, including narcotics or weapons.</p>
    	<p>Be sure to check your legislation before ordering anything.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="col text-center">
    	{{< img src="crypto-101/icons/third-party.svg" class="img-fluid" alt="Merchant selling from kiosk" >}}
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

Because Bitcoin has matured to a global market, more and more merchants are encouraged to accept cryptocurrencies as a form of payment.
