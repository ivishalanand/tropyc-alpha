## Bitcoin, a new asset class

Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies follow a decentralised economic model: unlike the process of printing money, Bitcoins' issuance rate is transparent, immutable and fair.

{{< img src="crypto-101/charts/chart-btc-supply.png" class="img-fluid mb-5" alt="Bitcoin emission rate" >}}

Bitcoin has a fixed and controlled supply. The rate of Bitcoin creation decreases with time, to converge towards a 21 million total supply.  
Every ten minutes, the blockchain records the number of new bitcoins created and to who it is rewarded.

{{< img src="crypto-101/charts/chart-btc-reward.png" class="img-fluid mb-5" alt="Bitcoin incentives per block" >}}

Miners earn their return on investment in Bitcoin, from transactions fees and new Bitcoins added to the total supply. As the mining incentive stays constant, transaction fees increase over time with block rewards being inversely correlated to them.

The rate of mining Bitcoin is predictable and known to everyone on the network.  

* Externalities cannot vary the issuance of bitcoin.
* Bitcoins are becoming more scarce.
* Its monetary system is not inflationist like in fiat, but dis-inflationist

Bitcoin is a new kind of financial instrument that holds different fundamentals than conventional asset classes.

As Bitcoin is relatively new, financial regulators have not defined its nature thoroughly. Here we offer three different interpretations of Bitcoin.

With the emergence of smart contract development platform, digital assets can have new functions - virtually anything that can be programmed. Skip to Chapter IV for more information.

## Is Bitcoin money?

Although Bitcoin is appealing to new audiences by the day, would it be institutionalised investors or individuals, it’s hard to estimate the proportion of household capital in the cryptocurrency economy.

All we know, is that everyone can use it. Bitcoin is a new a type of asset class introduced to the economy. But is it money? Money can be any instrument that serves as:

### Store of wealth

An efficient store of wealth will not see its value decrease in the long term. In other words, selecting an asset as a store of value is the same as forecasting an increase in the asset demand.

Precious metals, such as gold, have been historically efficient stores of wealth: they are durable, scarce, easy to identify and difficult to forge.

Nicknamed the “digital gold” by Nathaniel Popper, Bitcoin holds similar characteristics, making it an eligible candidate for a new kind of store of value.

Unless a considerable share of the population perceives Bitcoin as an efficient store of wealth (just like gold), defining it as _efficient_ is debatable and controversial.  
Bitcoin's prices have soared since its existence, therefore assessing its efficiency should always be relative to another class of assets.

Amid unstable economy, fast-paced globalisation and new technology breakthroughs, no one can point to an item and declare with reasonable certainty that “this is and always will be a great store of wealth” - the same applies to Bitcoin.

### Unit of account

The unit of account is the currency of measure that will be used to represent the real value of an economy. It translates the value of an item into a quantifiable unit: it becomes the monetary convention.

For this matter, you can regard US Dollars as the world currency or bitcoin or gold or even oil. Depending on your point of view we can analyse events differently:

{{< img src="crypto-101/charts/chart-eco-btcusd.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Chart world GDP BTC vs USD" >}}

The above illustrates the state of the economy of World Bank Group participants (170+ countries) since 2013. In USD, the economy is somewhat stable, however, in Bitcoin, the economy is collapsing.

Cryptocurrencies are still infamous globally compared to established government-backed currencies: they are not a good unit of account to value our economy because prices of goods and services in Bitcoin are unstable.

However, it does not mean that cryptocurrencies cannot fulfil this role in the future; they have all the required features to do so.

It is important to note that in the cryptocurrency world, Bitcoin IS the unit of account, as every cryptocurrencies are priced in BTC and not in USD.

### Medium of exchange

The last and most important feature of money is the ability to transfer value from one peer to another. Bitcoin is a perfect medium of exchange thanks to its core features as reviewed in Part I.

Bitcoin's fast, safe and low-cost transactions triggered the exponential demand for cryptocurrencies and made Bitcoin what it is today. There is no doubt that digital currencies are outperforming conventional banking services in cross-border and high amount settlements.  

As for domestic and low ticket transactions, debit and credit card as well as mobile money are all faster and cheaper for consumers.

Originally, Bitcoin as a medium of exchange started on the dark web. Its primary use was to settle payments for illicit goods on illegal marketplaces. Bitcoin's ability to dissociate someone's identity with financial transactions made it the perfect "drug money".  

Today, many well-reputable merchants have integrated Bitcoin as a form of payment.

## Market fundamentals

### Platform

Exchanges are opened five days per week but close on weekends and evenings. It is possible to trade throughout the day, but investors and speculators have to switch markets.

Bankers typically alternate between America, Europe and Asia to operate continuously on regulated markets.

Cryptocurrency markets on the other hand, are open 24/7 non-stop on online exchanges: you can trade whenever you feel like it. There are two different types of cryptocurrency exchanges:

* **fiat to crypto**, with extensive KYC compliance and where you can deposit and withdraw in fiat and cryptocurrency
* **crypto to crypto**, with low or no KYC compliance and where you can only deposit and withdraw in cryptocurrency

### Price

Bitcoin is the pioneer of digital money and is therefore witnessing tremendous growth.  
Thanks to its flexibility towards privacy, its peer-to-peer transactions, supply scarcity and hedging opportunity against the fiat economy, Bitcoin offers an attractive investment opportunity and fulfils, to some extent, the functions of money.  
However, Bitcoin and the cryptocurrency market as a whole is subject to different rules when it comes to price volatility and liquidity.

The Bitcoin to dollar pair witnesses substantial volatility compared to fiat currency exchange pairs: it is not uncommon to witness a 50% price variation on Bitcoin in a couple of weeks.     
A similar pattern in fiat currencies would shake up the global economy.

Regarding liquidity, the daily volume of exchange trades from fiat to cryptocurrency was ridiculous at first, making cryptocurrencies illiquid. But Bitcoin has established itself as the leading cryptocurrency: it is now extremely liquid, however, the same cannot be said for other cryptocurrencies.
