## Set-up

Managing crypto-wealth starts with setting up two wallets:

* One hot wallet for daily expenses, that should not hold a huge chunk of your capital.
* One cold wallet to store the rest of your crypto assets.

Hot wallets are the epicentre of wallet management system. They interact with both the outside world and offline storage. On the other hand, cold wallets should exclusively interact with hot wallets.

In personal finance, hot wallets are current accounts and cold wallets are savings accounts.

## Cryptography pair

A wallet can generate an unlimited amount of private key and public address combinations. However, a wallet (and its password) does not need to be generated for every pair.  
Because the blockchain is transparent, one should avoid re-utilising a public address as its balance is available online.

It is important to generate new public addresses for every transaction; otherwise, the person you transact with will match the public address' balance with your identity.

Since the blockchain tracks all transactions, sharing used public addresses for payment means sharing your account balance to a third party.

## Encryption

Setting up a wallet password is mandatory if you want to store your crypto safely. Be sure your password follows the undermentioned:

* **Length**: minimum of 12 characters.
* **Unique**: never been used before.
* **Random**: no meaning and with all types of characters.

A good idea for extra security is to use Multiple Factor Authentication, an additional layer of protection for your account. There are three different authentication factors:Â  _knowledge_, _possession_ and _inherence_.  
Under the 2-FA framework, you have to present two components of authentication to access your account.  
In most cases, a 2-FA encryption will work with a smartphone: you can access your wallet (or any encrypted account) only after entering your password (knowledge) successfully and insert a code generated from a mobile app (possession).

**WARNING! SMS-based 2-FA is not considered safe, use only certified applications.**

## Centralisation

It's best to avoid storing 100% of capital in one bank account, and the same applies with cryptocurrency.
You do not want to keep everything in one wallet or in one place.
