Bitcoin is the first cryptocurrency ever conceptualised, first and foremost it offers an alternative monetary system to our economy: a decentralised one.

In crypto, governments and central banks have no authority towards the issuance of additional currency. Both regulators and middlemen lose their respective influence in the equation.  
Banks have become redundant because now, you can become your own bank.

### Fiat

Depositing funds into a bank account means trusting a centralised entity (banks) to hold your wealth.  
They have the power to freeze your account, put consumer limits or delay access to funds.

### Crypto

In cryptocurrency, you have the flexibility to either:

* Keep full control over your wealth
* Trust a third party to store your capital

A cold wallet lets you store your cryptocurrencies offline and keep an eye on it, while an online wallet gives you a similar centralised experience as with banks.

Beware, when storing your Bitcoin on third-party wallets, you do not "own" a bitcoin, but an "IOU": you assume the third party is trustworthy enough, to send you your Bitcoin when requested!

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

### Fiat

Merchants, banks and consumers can cancel a transaction after payment confirmation.  
The current payment infrastructure offers many safety nets in case something goes wrong, such as insurance for stolen cards or Electronic Payment Terminal's cancel feature.

However, refunds are sometimes not possible in the event of a mistake, especially during interbank wiring.

### Crypto

There is no rewinding back once a transaction is signed, verified and confirmed. The blockchain is **immutable**: there is no way to cancel a transaction. In this sense, the network is _non-repudiable_.

Always verify the public address before sending a transaction; otherwise, your Bitcoins will be lost forever. Also, when interacting with merchants and vendors, go through an escrow service: it adds a layer of protection to ensure the service/good is delivered.

### Fiat economy

Card issuers, payment gateways, insurance and merchants are very open to refunding a transaction if something adverse happened. 
It is not only about solving discrepancies but also part of improving customer experience.  
The fiat economy offers several layers of protection against scams, fraud and mistakes.

That being said, wiring cash to an incorrect bank account might result in a loss of money, and physical cash is always at the mercy of physical attacks.

### Crypto

The cryptocurrency network is very new and attracts many opportunists. There are many scams and frauds in this ecosystem that leverages the blockchain's immutability features.

It is your responsibility to store your Bitcoins and cryptocurrencies safely in a digital wallet.  
Your crypto portfolio is vulnerable to theft if you have not secured it well.

Be careful!

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

### Fiat

Although cash remains the most private way to transact, it is only suitable for lower amounts. 

On the other hand, electronic payments can handle higher amounts but record the identity of all the stakeholders engaged in the transaction.  
This leaves a trace that can be audited by financial institutions and governments.
Furthermore, electronic payment systems are vulnerable to hacks and thefts.

### Crypto

The Bitcoin blockchain has imperfect knowledge of a user's identity, meaning public addresses are not easily linked back to an individual's identity.

Users have the flexibility to detach their financial behaviour from their identity if they want to stay private.

Centralised tools, such as tumbler and mixers, can increase the difficulty of tracing back Bitcoins to an individual. Moreover, privacy-focused cryptocurrencies have recently emerged and can help users achieve full anonymity, check out our review [here] (/news/privacy-focused-tokens “Privacy Focused Tokens”)

### Fiat

Only few stakeholders have access to transaction and bank settlement history. Although account audit occurs on a yearly basis, there is no live feed available for the public to scrutinise.

The fiat economy is closed-source, only regulators and financial institutions have access to some extent to bank accounts and their transactions.

### Crypto

The blockchain is a distributed public ledger that anyone can access at any time. This gives full knowledge of all the transactions that occurred on the network.

The Bitcoin code, emission rate and blockchain activity is open-source.

### Fiat

The current monetary policy is inflationist: the government can print money endlessly. By doing so, the aim is to trigger consumption and keep the rise in prices in a pre determined target zone. 

Government can inject fresh capital into the economy by purchasing assets from or issuing debt to financial institutions and industrialists. Boosting the economy by creating electronically money is a practice called "quantitative easing".

There are two drawbacks:

* Inflation means the value of one monetary unit decreases.
* Quantitive easing (the act of printing fiat) may benefit more to the higher income segments since governments inject capital by purchasing assets from and issuing debt in bulk to the banking sector.

### Crypto

The Bitcoin supply is capped at 21 million units: this means it is deflationist (not every cryptocurrency is deflationist). In other words, the number of Bitcoins added to the economy every year gets smaller and smaller.

The supply is not influenced by any externalities and not controlled by a centralised authority. In fact, the rate of issuance is transparent and available to anyone.

As Bitcoin's market penetration is going up, Bitcoins are becoming more and more scarce.

International card issuers such as Visa or MasterCard handle hundreds of millions of transactions per day. When purchasing a good or service through them, the payment is fast, secure and quite cheap.

### Crypto

A Bitcoin transaction takes 10 minutes to get recorded into a block, verified and added to the blockchain. 
Not the best scenario for merchants: waiting this amount of time to get the money cleared out creates a considerable risk for them.  
On the other hand, clients cannot wait 10 minutes at the till.

However, new cryptocurrencies and blockchain startups have been very innovative in the space and are offering lower tansaction time in order to solve Bitcoin's block time issue.

### Fiat

The current payment technology, SWIFT, can take up to 7 days to execute a payment and incurs massive costs in some scenarios. Also, banks often charge (hidden) fees and commissions on the conversion rate.

When an international transaction occurs, money could be missing on both the sender and recipient bank accounts for several days. This is due to interbank settlement processes, where the money has to be wired to several banks before arrival.

### Crypto

The Bitcoin network is perfect for cross border transactions and settlements. You can transfer value overseas at a minimal cost and very quickly.

### Fiat

Fiat currencies are considered legal tender, meaning they are legally recognised by public institutions to settle financial obligations between parties.

There are rules to follow when handling fiat money: trespassing them can lead to legal recourse.

* Pay tax on your income and wealth.
* Abstain from purchasing illegal goods and services.
* Settle financial obligation if contractually agreed upon.

### Crypto

Depending on the country, Bitcoin has different legal statuses. While some countries like Bangladesh or Bolivia banned the use of Bitcoin, Japan decided in 2017 to declare it as legal tender.

Bitcoin has historically been assimilated to online drug trafficking and money laundering activities because of its privacy features and ease of settling cross-border payments. 

Still, most of the countries have no solid legal framework put in place for digital currencies. The lack of regulation is somewhat beneficial as it does not hamper any innovation in the industry. However, some money laundering activities and illegal transactions might be occurring on the network of well established cryptocurrencies.

The same way the Internet was at first unregulated, cryptocurrencies enjoy a grey zone legal status in most countries.
