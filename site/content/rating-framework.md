+++

Tropyc rates ICO and token sales based on the information they chose to release. 
The rating framework evaluates the risk of fraud and assesses the project's credibility to go through a fundraising round.

**Our rating system is not an endorsement to projects and is not to be considered by any means as investment, accounting or legal advice.**

It is divided into six sub-marks:
